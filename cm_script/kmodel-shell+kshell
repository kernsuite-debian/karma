# After processing all commands, the Connection Management tool will wait
# forever in an event loop. When any module dies or connection closes,
# all slave processes and controlled modules should finish. A number of shell
# commands may then be processed prior to the Connection Management tool
# terminating.

echo "Application finished"

# No "END" directive is required: EndOfFile is sufficient
