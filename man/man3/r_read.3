.TH R_READ 3 "24 Dec 2005" "Karma Distribution"
.SH FUNCTION
r_read \- Read bytes from a file descriptor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <karma_r.h>
.sp
.B iaddr r_read
.sp
(int fd, char *buf, uaddr nbytes)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine is similar to the system <<read(2)>> call, except
that the number of bytes requested is always returned (except on error or
closure). Hence, if the descriptor references a socket, the routine will
read as much data as was requested, rather than a lesser amount due to
packetisation or interrupted system calls.
.IP \fIfd\fP 1i
The file descriptor to read from. This descriptor must NOT be set to
non-blocking IO.
.IP \fIbuf\fP 1i
The buffer in which to write the data.
.IP \fInbytes\fP 1i
The number of bytes to read.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The number of bytes requested on success, the number of bytes
read on end of file (or closure) and -1 on error.
.SH Multi-threading Level
Unsafe.
