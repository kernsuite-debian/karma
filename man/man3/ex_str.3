(CONST char *str, CONST char **rest)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine will extract a sub-string from a string. The
sub-string may be delimited by any number of whitespace characters. The
double quote character may appear anywhere in the sub-string, and will
force all whitespace characters except '\n' into the output string. A
second double quote character unquotes the previous quote. These double
quote characters are not copied, unless they are consecutive. If the string
contains only two double quote characters, an empty string (i.e. only a
'\0' character is present) is returned.
.IP \fIstr\fP 1i

A pointer beyond the value will be written here. If this is NULL,
nothing is written here.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A pointer to a copy of the sub-string.
.SH Multi-threading Level
