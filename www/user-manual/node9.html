This tool allows you to browse your datacube searching for expanding
shells. Since most shells are mostly radially symmetric, it is
reasonable to azimuthally average concentric annuli around a
designated centre. What this means is that the programme allows you to
define a centre position on the sky and a maximum radius. It will then
step through a range of radii (from zero to the maximum), and at each
radius will average the values in one velocity map around the
circumference of a circle (hence ``azimuthal average''). This process
is repeated for each velocity map, and the result is an image with one
axis corresponding to radius and the other velocity.
<P>
If you are looking at an expanding shell, for each velocity map the
average radius of the emission from the centre is approximately
constant. As you progress from one velocity extreme to the other, the
radius will change from zero, pass through a maximum at the central
velocity and go back down to zero. So, in the computed radius-velocity
map, you should see half an ellipse (the ``signature''). If you have
slightly missed the centre of the expansion, you will see a double
ellipse, so this is a good way of finding the centre. If you are not
looking at an expanding shell at all, you just see a mess, so this is
also a good way for speculatively searching for shells. The lower the
expansion velocity, the more squashed the ellipse becomes (vertically,
of course). In fact, if you had a static shell, you would just see a
straight line.  The power of this tool is that it is both a fast way
of browsing for expanding shells (because of their charactistic
signature) and that it is insensitive to fragmentation of shells.
<P>
To drive this programme, you need a cube file (load with the
<B>Cubes</B> button) and an image file (load with the
<B>Images</B> button). Actually, the image file is optional: you
can compute an image on the fly from the cube by selecting say the
<B>0th moment</B> option from the <B>Image Mode</B> menu, and
adjusting the parameters as needed and pressing <B>Apply</B>. The
reason you need an image is so that you can search for a possible
centre of an expanding shell. The image is displayed in the left
window. The image and cube files do not have to lie on the same
co-ordinate grid.
<P>
Once you have loaded your files, you simply click with the middle
mouse button (don't let go yet!) to define the centre of the shell,
``drag'' the mouse so that you see the expanding circle, and release
the middle button when you think the radius is sufficiently large such
that the entire shell is enclosed. Don't make it larger than is really
necessary, since it will take longer for the programme to compute the
radius-velocity image. After a short time (fraction of a second to a
few seconds for typical cubes), you will see the computed
radius-velocity image. Do you see a nice ellipse in the right window?
If you move the mouse into the right window, you should see the
current position (in sensible units) as well as the averaged intensity
at that point. You can use the <B>Export</B> menu above the image
to write the image (with co-ordinates) in a variety of formats (choose
one of the ``(whole dataset)'' options).
<P>
A small tip for people looking at data with very high dynamic range
(such as OHIR masers): set intensity scale for the right window to
logarithmic (see the <A HREF="node3.html#sectionzooming">zooming</A> section),
otherwise you will only see a few bright blobs.
