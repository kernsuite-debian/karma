<P>
Karma has a facility to annotate 2-D images with lines, boxes, and
other simple figures, as well as strings of text.  Commands to draw
these various things are stored in text files which are read in by
selecting the ``Load Annotations'' option from the ``Overlays'' button
menu (see &#167;<A HREF="node3.html#sectionloadingoverlays">2.20</A>).  The names of annotation
files must have the extension ``.ann'' or ``.ANN'' for Karma to
recognize them.  Annotations read from a file can be removed from the
image with the ``Remove'' buttons in the Annotation File Loader.
Often the best way to produce a good set of annotations for a
particular image is to see what an annotation file produces on the
screen, then modify the file contents, remove the annotations, and
reload the file, until everything appears satisfactory.
<P>
Note the annotations descibed here only work with 2-D images, or 2-D
slices of 3-D images.  For information on marking rendered 3-D images
with line segments in <B>&lt;xray&gt;</B>, see
&#167;<A HREF="node6.html#sectionxraysegments">5.4</A>.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001720000000000000000">D.2 Fundamental Syntax</A></H1>
<P>
Annotation file syntax is very simple.  Commands are listed in the
order they are to be performed, separated by carriage returns.  Each
command is followed by one or more arguments, which may be separated
with commas, spaces, or tabs.  Comments may be placed in the
annotation file by using a comment character (#).  All text occuring
after a comment character on the same line is ignored.  Blank lines
are also ignored.  The syntax is case-insensitive: UPPER, lower or
MiXeD cases are all valid.  Commands can be extended over more than
one line of text by placing a continuation character (<IMG WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5012" SRC="img17.gif">) at
the end of each line to be continued.  Any text appearing after the
continuation character on the same line is ignored.  Continuation
characters do not continue comments, only command strings; therefore,
any (<IMG WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5012" SRC="img17.gif">) following a (#) is ignored.  If the line following
a continued line is blank or a comment line, the continuation is
terminated.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> The parser ignores any spaces, tabs, or commas preceding
``useful'' text on a command line.  Consequently, a space should be
placed prior to the continuation character if the text beginning on
the following line is not to be considered part of the last argument
on the current (continued) line.  The reason for this is to allow a
long argument (<I>e.g.,</I> a really long font name) to be broken up
if necessary without being treated as two separate arguments.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001730000000000000000">D.3 Annotation Commands</A></H1>
<P>
There are three types of commands: those which draw objects, those
which change attributes of objects, and non-graphical commands.  A
complete list of currently implemented commands is given below, with
syntaxes and brief descriptions.  In the syntax lists, the command is
given in <TT>CAPS</TT> (with occasional synonyms in parentheses).
Required arguments follow in <TT>&lt;angle brackets&gt;</TT>, and optional
arguments or argument groups in <TT>[square brackets]</TT>.  The brackets
are for illustration only and should not be typed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001731000000000000000">Non-Graphical Commands</A></H2>
<P>
At present there is only one of these, but it is quite useful.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>INCLUDE &lt;name of file&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Includes the contents of another annotation file in the current one.
The parser acts on the instructions it finds in the included file
before moving to the next command in the present one.  Thus one can
include the same file's worth of annotations in several different
files without having to maintain multiple copies.  Furthermore, by
specifying attributes such as color in the parent file instead of the
included file, the attributes can be changed from one inclusion to the
next.
<P>
The filename can include the ``<IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=5 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline4628" SRC="img1.gif">'' notation, as well as other
simple Borne Shell-like expansions of environment variables using the<BR> 
<TT>$variable</TT>, <TT>${variable}</TT> and <TT>${variable:-word}</TT>
notations.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> Filenames are case-sensitive on many operating systems
(<I>e.g.</I>, Unix).  Also, when using multi-level inclusion (including
files which include other files, etc.), be careful with relative
pathnames.  The parser's working directory remains that of the
original file; thus, if <TT>file1.ann</TT> has <TT>INCLUDE
subdir/file2.ann</TT> and that file has <TT>INCLUDE file3.ann</TT>, Karma
will look for <TT>file3.ann</TT> in the directory containing <TT>
file1.ann</TT>, not in <TT>subdir/</TT>.  Unless all the files are in the
same directory, it's probably safer to use absolute pathnames or
environment variables.
<P>
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION001732000000000000000">D.3.2 Attribute Commands</A></H2>
<P>
Attributes are general properties of objects.  An attribute command
sets one of these properties for all objects drawn after, until the
attribute is changed by another attribute command.  Each has an initial
value it is assigned when the application first starts.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>COLOR (or COLOUR) &lt;name of color&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Sets the color of subsequent objects.  The color name is a standard
system color, a list of which can be found for X-Windows systems in
the file /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt.  Basic color names include ``red'',
``green'', ``yellow'', ``white'', etc.  The default color is green.
<LI> <TT>FONT &lt;name of font&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Sets the font of subsequent text objects.  The font name is a standard
system font, a list of which can be found for X-Windows systems with
the command ``xlsfonts''.  The name of the default font is
``hershey14''. <I>Note: font names are case-sensitive!</I>
<LI> <TT>COORD &lt;default coordinate type (W, R, or P)&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Sets the default coordinate type of subsequent objects.  This will
apply to any objects which do not have a coordinate type given in
their command string.  Any coordinate type in an object command
string takes precedence over the default coordinate type, but only
applies to that particular object.  Some objects allow multiple
coordinate type arguments; in this case, each coordinate type given
applies only to vertices following it in the argument list, until
superceded by another coordinate type specification.  See below for
descriptions of the different coordinate types.  The initial setting
of <TT>COORD</TT> is <TT>W</TT>.
<LI> <TT>PA &lt;position angle convention (STANDARD or SKY)&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Sets the position angle convention for subsequent objects.  Unlike
coordinate type, position angle convention cannot be specified inside
an object command, but must be set with this attribute command.  See
below for descriptions of the two position angle conventions.  The
initial setting of <TT>PA</TT> is <TT>STANDARD</TT>.
<P>
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION001733000000000000000">D.3.3 Object Commands</A></H2>
<P>
Object commands draw specific objects over a displayed image.  These
include text strings as well as figures made up of dots and lines.
<P>
The locations of drawn objects can be specified in three types of
coordinates: world (<TT>W</TT>), relative (<TT>R</TT>), and pixel (<TT>P</TT>).
World coordinates are those indicated by axis labeling, e.g., right
ascension and declination (or velocity, in a position-velocity map)
-- but be careful about coordinate units, since annotations use the
units specified by the image header (e.g., the FITS standard default
units for right ascension are degrees, not hours, and for velocity are
m/s, not km/s!).  Relative coordinates range from 0 to 1 inside region
bounded by the image axes, increasing from the lower left corner of
the image.  Pixel coordinates count screen pixels explicitly in the
entire display region (including outside any labeled axes), beginning
in the <I>upper</I> left corner; note these are <I>not</I> image
pixels, but rather the physical pixels of the computer monitor screen.
Image pixel coordinates are not a usable coordinate type here, unless
no world coordinates are defined for the image, in which case Karma
will use the image pixel coordinates in place of world coordinates.
For most purposes involving the marking of image features, world
coordinates are the best choice, though relative coordinates are
occasionally good for marking a particular part of the display region
regardless of image projection.  Pixel coordinates, by their
inflexible nature, are as a rule not very useful.  The three
coordinate types are specified in an argument list with the letters
<TT>W</TT>, <TT>R</TT>, and <TT>P</TT>.
<P>
In several of the object commands below (<TT>DOTS, LINE, CLINES,
DLINES, VECTOR</TT>), different geometric parameters of the object can be
specified in different coordinate types, and so a coordinate type
argument may precede more than one coordinate pair in the argument
list.  However all coordinate type arguments are optional; they are
only necessary to override the current value -- either one specified
earlier in the argument list, or the default coordinate type selected
with the <TT>COORD</TT> attribute command.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>DOT (or POINT) [coord_type] &lt;x_coord&gt; &lt;y_coord&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Draw a single point.
<LI> <TT>DOTS (or POINTS) [coord_type] &lt;x1&gt; &lt;y1&gt;
[[coord_type] &lt;x2&gt; <BR> &lt;y2&gt;] ...</TT> <BR> 
Draw a collection of points.
<LI> <TT>LINE [coord_type] &lt;x1&gt; &lt;y1&gt; [coord_type] &lt;x2&gt;
&lt;y2&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Draw a line between two points.
<LI> <TT>CLINES [coord_type] &lt;x1&gt; &lt;y1&gt; [coord_type]
&lt;x2&gt; &lt;y2&gt; <BR> [[coord_type] &lt;x3&gt; &lt;y3&gt;] ...</TT> <BR> 
Draw a series of connected lines (``connect the dots'').
<LI> <TT>DLINES [coord_type] &lt;x1&gt; &lt;y1&gt; [coord_type]
&lt;x2&gt; &lt;y2&gt; <BR> [[coord_type] &lt;x3&gt; &lt;y3&gt; [coord_type]
&lt;x4&gt; &lt;y4&gt;] ...</TT> <BR> 
Draw a collection of disconnected lines.
<LI> <TT>VECTOR [coord_type] &lt;x_base&gt; &lt;y_base&gt;
[coord_type] &lt;x_comp&gt; <BR> &lt;y_comp&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Draw a vector with specified components at a given location.  At
present this is just a line, with no arrowhead drawn.  However, unlike
the <TT>LINE</TT> command, which specifies coordinates of both endpoints,
the arguments for <TT>VECTOR</TT> are the position of the base and the
components of the vector which get added to the base to determine the
other endpoint.
<LI> <TT>BOX [coord_type] &lt;x1&gt; &lt;y1&gt; &lt;x2&gt; &lt;y2&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Draw a rectangular box, given coordinates of two opposed corners.
<LI> <TT>CBOX [coord_type] &lt;x_cent&gt; &lt;y_cent&gt;
&lt;x_width&gt; &lt;y_height&gt; <BR> [angle] </TT> <BR> 
Draw a rotatable, rectangular box, given center coordinates, width,
and height, and an optional position angle in degrees.
<LI> <TT>CROSS [coord_type] &lt;x_cent&gt; &lt;y_cent&gt;
&lt;x_width&gt; &lt;y_height&gt; <BR> [angle] </TT> <BR> 
Draw a rotatable cross, given center coordinates, width, and height,
and an optional position angle in degrees.
<LI> <TT>CIRCLE [coord_type] &lt;x_cent&gt; &lt;y_cent&gt;
&lt;radius&gt; </TT> <BR> 
Draw a circle, given center coordinates and radius.
<LI> <TT>ELLIPSE [coord_type] &lt;x_cent&gt; &lt;y_cent&gt; &lt;a&gt;
&lt;b&gt; [angle] </TT> <BR> 
Draw a rotatable ellipse, given center coords, semimajor and semiminor
axes, and an optional position angle in degrees.  The semimajor axis
must be given before the semiminor axis if adherence to the standard
definition of ellipse position angle is desired.  In order to maintain
consistency with the <TT>CBOX</TT> and <TT>CROSS</TT> commands, the first
axis is the one oriented by the position angle, regardless of whether
it is the largest.
<LI> <TT>TEXT [coord_type] &lt;x_left&gt; &lt;y_left&gt;
&lt;string&gt;</TT> <BR> 
Draw a text string left-justified at the given coordinates (more
precisely, these specify the lower left corner of text).  The string
to be used is whatever follows the third argument, e.g., several words
separated by spaces, and ends with the line of text, unless continued
onto another line.  Comment (#) and continuation (<IMG WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5012" SRC="img17.gif">)
characters cannot be included in a text string, but are acted upon in
the usual fashion if found -- thus text commands can also be extended
to multiple lines.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
WARNING: At present, rotatable figures (boxes, crosses, and
ellipses) have a tendency to appear distorted from their ``real''
appearance in curved world coordinates, e.g., maps of the sky.  Proper
projection of geometric objects into world coordinates is a nontrivial
exercise and has been deferred.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001734000000000000000">D.3.4 Position Angle Conventions</A></H2>
<P>
<B>Standard Postition Angles</B> are generally defined in the Cartesian
sense where <IMG WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5262" SRC="img18.gif"> specifies {<IMG WIDTH=89 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5264" SRC="img19.gif">},
<IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5266" SRC="img20.gif"> specifies {<IMG WIDTH=89 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5268" SRC="img21.gif">}, and so forth.
In a coordinate system where X increases from left to right, and Y
increases from bottom to top, <I>PA</I> will increase in a
counter-clockwise direction.  However this will be reversed if the X
increases from right to left, or Y from top to bottom (though not
both).  So be careful!  To summarize: <I>PA</I> is measured CCW from right
in <TT>R</TT> coords, and CW from right in <TT>P</TT> coords.  How it is
measured in <TT>W</TT> coords depends on the coordinate system: in many
cases, it will be the same as <TT>R</TT> coords, but this is not always
true!  For example, most astronomical maps of the sky have the X
coordinate increasing toward the left, in which case, <I>PA</I> will be
measured CW from left!
<P>
<B>Sky Position Angles</B> are for the astronomers.  Usage of this
convention in annotations assumes two things: (1) a map of the sky is
being displayed, with the X coordinate increasing from right to left,
and the Y coordinate increasing from bottom to top, i.e., north = up,
south = down, east = left, west = right; and (2)&nbsp;position angle is
measured from north through east (up through left).  The convention is
followed regardless of whether the coordinate type is <TT>W</TT>, <TT>
R</TT>, or <TT>P</TT>.  So unlike <TT>STANDARD</TT> position angles, <TT>SKY</TT>
PAs retain their appearance regardless of coordinate type.  This same
system can be used with Ecliptic and Galactic coordinates as well as
Equatorial, though the <IMG WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5262" SRC="img18.gif"> referent points up in all cases,
toward the grid's north pole.  <I>However</I> unless the image
projection is flat, <IMG WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5262" SRC="img18.gif"> will only point exactly north at the
image projection center (but if the image covers a small piece of the
sky and is not close to a coordinate pole, the error will be small).
Generalizing this to be correct in all parts of the image is a future
project.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001740000000000000000">D.4 Example Annotation File</A></H1>
<P>
Two sample annotation files, <TT>m42.ann</TT> and <TT>m42_include.ann</TT>,
have been provided to illustrate the functions and concepts outlined
above.  To use these example files properly in Karma, it is necessary
to load the FITS image m42_ha.fits to set the world coordinates.  For
best image appearance, select a square root intensity scale from the
Intensity Policy popup, and a 99.99% intensity range from the IScale
popup.
