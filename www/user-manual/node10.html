<P>
This tool allows you to quickly place a co-ordinate system (compute a
plate solution) onto an image which does not have one. This is very
useful if you have, say, a CCD image which does not have a co-ordinate
system on it. All you need is an image of a similar piece of sky which
does have a co-ordinate system (such as an image from the Digital Sky
Survey). The tool handles flipping and rotation correctly. This tool
is much faster to use than the various command-line driven tools
currently available (usually less than a minute).
<P>
After you start the tool, you will get two windows. The left window
should be loaded with the reference image (the image which has a
co-ordinate system), by pressing <B>Ref. Images</B>. The right
window should be loaded with your target image (the image without the
co-ordinate system), by pressing <B>Target Images</B>.
<P>
The programme should also work with a photographic negative. The
picking algorithm is automatically modified to look for a trough
rather than a peak.
<P>
Once you have loaded your images, you are now ready to define matching
pairs of points (stars). To do this, you must first click (middle) in
the left window, near a star, and then click (middle) in the right
window near the corresponding star. You then go back to the left
window and define another star, and click on it's mate in the right
window. You must define at least three pairs of stars.
<P>
As you select a star, a green circle is drawn around the fitted centre
of the star. If at any time you miss the star, you can just click
again (only before going to the other window). If you press
<B>Undo Pair</B>, a pair of stars will be removed from the list. As
long as some visible part of the star is within the circle cursor
(also known as the ``capture region'') when you click (middle), the
tool will find the centroid of the star.
<P>
You might find it helpful to click the <B>Magnifier</B> button to see
the magnifier window. You will see a crosshair which is centred on the
current mouse position in the main window. You will also see a green
circle which shows the ``capture region'': if any part of the star
lies within that circle, when you click (middle) the centroid of the
star will be picked. You can adjust the size of the capture region by
clicking with the left mouse button in the magnifier window. You will
also see a dashed green circle which is slightly larger than the solid
green circle. The area between the two circles is called the
background annulus. The magnifier will also show small red crosshairs
at the exact centroid positions of selected stars.
<P>
Once you have selected all your star pairs, you can click on
<B>Compute Co-ordinate System</B> and the tool solves for a
co-ordinate system. In your command-line window a report of the
solution is displayed. If you move your mouse around the right window,
you will see the proper world co-ordinates of the pixels. Once you are
happy with the co-ordinate solution, you can press the <B>Apply
Co-ordinate System</B> button, and then save the image (with the new
co-ordinate system) using the <B>Export</B> menu. The coordinate
system is written in the header using the standard (CTYPEn, CRVALn,
CDELTn, CRPIXn) notation.
<P>
The coordinate system is computed under the assumption that the image
of the sky has been projected by the telescope optics in a particular
way. The projection geometry is assumed to be the Rectangular
projection (denoted by the standard projection name ``ARC''), which is
used by Schmidt telescopes. This may not be always be the appropriate
projection to use, but the errors should only become noticeable for
fields larger than 0.5&nbsp;degree.

<P>
<A NAME="pubcentroidingalgorithm">&#160;</A>
<P>
The following steps are taken by the picking algorithm:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> find the brightest pixel within the circle cursor (``capture
region'')
<LI> proceed from that point by ``walking up the hill'', searching
for a neighbouring pixel which is of a greater value. It continues
searching until it finds a pixel with no neighbours with a greater
value (i.e. a local maximum). This is usually the peak pixel
<LI> find the half-intensity size of the star. To do this it needs an
estimate of the background value. The background is computed by
finding the median value inside the background annulus
<LI> computes the centroid position by using a two-dimensional
weighted mean algorithm. The centroid is computed out to the
half-intensity size.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Note that the centring algorithm will not work with heavily clipped
images. This is because there is no real peak to work with, rather
there is only a plateau. In these cases, the centring algorithm is
effectively bypassed and the position you selected will be used for
the star position. This allows you to position by eye. Please note
that heavily clipped images have lost information, and hence the
accuracy of star positions will be limited.
