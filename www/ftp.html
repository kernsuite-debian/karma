<title>Current Karma Runtime Distributions</title>

<body>
<h2>
This page contains links to the current runtime distributions of
Karma v1.7.25.
</h2>

<hr>
Runtime distributions do not include source code.
New features in the API which appear in a pre-release may change again in
a later pre-release or full release, without warning. The main reason
pre-release runtime distributions are made available is so people can try
various applications supplied with Karma.
Runtime distributions typically come out once or twice a month, whereas
full public releases (i.e. with source code) only come out once or twice
a year.

<h3>
Easy Installation and Upgrading: recommended
</h3>
The easiest method for installing and upgrading Karma is to run the
<tt>install-karma</tt> script. This script figures out what kind of
machine you are running on, and will install/update the appropriate
runtime distribution of Karma. Below are the instructions for how to
install/upgrade Karma using this script. It assumes you have privilege
to install in <tt>/usr/local</tt>.
<p>
To install Karma, you will first need to run the following command:
<pre>
rsync -a rsync.ras.ucalgary.ca::karma/common/ /usr/local/karma
</pre>
After you have done this, the following command is used to complete
installation or to perform an upgrade:
<pre>
/usr/local/karma/csh_script/install-karma [destdir]
</pre>
where <tt>destdir</tt> is an optional directory in which to
install/upgrade (the default is <tt>/usr/local/karma</tt>).
<br>
The <tt>install-karma</tt> script is very efficient in the way it uses
network resources, and will only download changes that you do not
already have (it uses the excellent
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> programme to achieve 
this). Because of this, you can run the script periodically to obtain
automatic upgrades without having to worry about wasting network
resources. The simplest way to set up automatic upgrades is to create
a crontab entry such as:
<pre>
7 1 * * * /usr/local/karma/csh_script/install-karma
</pre>
If you are unsure how to create a crontab entry, run the following
commands:
<pre>
cd
echo "7 1 * * * /usr/local/karma/csh_script/install-karma" > .crontab
crontab .crontab
</pre>
Automatic Karma upgrades are now enabled. At 1:07 am each night (local
time), Karma will be updated.
<p>
If you have <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">gpg</a> (GNU Privacy Guard
aka. GnuPG) installed, the <tt>install-karma</tt> script can be used
to verify signatures on the files being downloaded. If a file is not
properly signed, it will not be installed. This will protect you from
a compromised download server. Before using this feature, make sure
you have <tt>gpgv</tt> installed in your path. The public keys are
kept in the <tt>share/signing-keys</tt> directory. The current signing
key is:
<pre>
pub   1024D/1B912A8C 2000-07-22
      Key fingerprint = 61D5 6EA3 29E8 BDBC C8AF  B8DA 826B A3AA 1B91 2A8C
</pre>
To use this feature, pass the <tt>-secure</tt> option to the
<tt>install-karma</tt> script. Note that the signature verification
can take a while on slower machines.

<h4>
Manual Downloading and Installing: <em>not</em> recommended
</h4>

<b>Do not send questions regarding installation unless you have first
tried the recommended "Easy Installation and Upgrading" described
above. If you experience a problem with easy installation, include
any error output in your email.
<p>
Note that manual downloading requires the use of ftp, which is blocked
by some firewalls. Use the rsync-based, easy installation method
instead. I mean it.
</b>
<p>
There is a binary distribution for each different machine/Operating System.
There is also a common "share" distribution file
"karma.share-v1.7.25.tar.gz" which contains documentation,
include files, font files and so on.

The combination of a binary distribution and share distribution makes up
a runtime distribution, and contains everything you need to run Karma
applications and build your own applications using the Karma library.
<p>
NOTE: the share distribution contains data required by the
applications as well as include files (for programming with
Karma). Since these change from one runtime release to the next, you
<b>must</b> always get the share distribution as well as the binary
distribution, otherwise your applications will not work properly.
<hr>
To install a runtime distribution, change directory to
<tt>/usr/local</tt> and unpack the binary and share
distributions. This will create a directory called <tt>karma</tt>
which contains everything you need.<br>
If you use the C shell, type: <tt>source /usr/local/karma/.login</tt><br>
If you use Bash, type: <tt>. /usr/local/karma/.karmarc</tt><br>
and your paths will be set up.
