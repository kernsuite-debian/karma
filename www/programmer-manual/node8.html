<H1><A NAME="SECTION00810000000000000000">Purpose</A></H1>
<P>
The image display support is intended to ease the display of computed
images by modules (applications). In most situations, the X Window
system is used as the basic graphics system. However, there is more to
image display than just writing a 2-D array to the graphics system.
Issues such as handling window resize events, colourmap resizes, fast
movie animation, controlled zooming, cursor events, etc. complicate
applications requiring image display. Besides, you may want to display
a 2-D array as a contour map, rather than as a bitmapped image. The
image display support provided in the Karma library can save thousands
of lines of messy, intricate code.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00820000000000000000">Related documents</A></H1>
<P>
The documentation on ``Intelligent Arrays'', communications support,
colourmap support and image editing support are highly recommended.
The documentation on Karma widgets explains how to build a complete
graphical application using the Xt Graphical User Interface toolkit.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00830000000000000000">Architecture</A></H1>
<P>
The image display support in Karma is built on a layered approach, in
a similar way to the communications support. The image display support
requires linking of the core Karma library and the Karma graphics
library.
<P>
The various packages in the Karma library which provide image display
support are listed below.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00831000000000000000">``ds'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The starting point for image display support in Karma is based on
direct conversion from 2-D array to image display. Any simple, 2-D
array using the Karma data format may be easily displayed.  The data
structure support is provided by the <A NAME="tex2html93" HREF="../lib/ds.html"><B>ds</B></A> package. You can
also construct your own C arrays and use a function like
<A NAME="tex2html94" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_wrap_preallocated_n_element_array"><B>ds_wrap_preallocated_n_element_array</B></A> to create the
Karma data structure wrappers for the data, and then pass these to the
graphics library.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00832000000000000000">``xi'' package</A></H2>
<P>
X11 XImage structure manipulation support is provided by the
<A NAME="tex2html95" HREF="../lib/xi.html"><B>xi</B></A> package. This package is not meant to be used by the
application programmer: it provides support for higher levels in the
Karma library. It is mentioned here only for reference.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00833000000000000000">``imw'' package</A></H2>
<P>
Image display support is provided by the <A NAME="tex2html96" HREF="../lib/imw.html"><B>imw</B></A> package. This
code is not meant to be used by the application programmer: it
provides support for higher levels in the Karma library. It is
mentioned here only for reference.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00834000000000000000">``kwin'' package</A></H2>
<A NAME="465">&#160;</A>
<P>
The lowest level display canvas is provided by the <A NAME="tex2html97" HREF="../lib/kwin.html"><B>kwin</B></A>
package. It provides a pixel canvas class. A pixel canvas is graphics
system independent. The graphics system is the layer of software that
provides basic access to display hardware. There is support for the
following graphics systems:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The X Window System (using Xlib)
<LI> The XGL rendering library
<LI> The OpenGL rendering library
<LI> A VX board (used to be hot stuff in it's day:-)
</UL><H3><A NAME="SECTION00834100000000000000">Purpose</A></H3>
<P>
Routines are provided to create a pixel canvas from an X window. Many
pixel canvases may be created per X window (though typically only one)
and mosaiced. The routines to create pixel canvases are naturally
graphics system dependent.
<P>
A number of routines allow drawing onto a pixel canvas. These routines
have generic interfaces (i.e. no reference to the graphics system such
as X). This allows an application to be written that can easily be
ported to a non-X environment (provided the Karma graphics library
supports the new graphics system). Note that these drawing routines
generally do NOT perform any &quot;clipping&quot;. If an object is drawn outside
the pixel canvas boundaries, it is not necessarily clipped. It is the
responsibility of the underlying graphics system (i.e. X) to handle
this. The reason for this is that it is not my purpose to reinvent X,
but rather to ease the porting of image display applications to
specialised display hardware and different windowing systems, as well
as providing some higher-level graphics primitives.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00834200000000000000">Graphics Primitives</A></H3>
<P>
Drawing operations on a pixel canvas are given in terms of pixels. The
origin of a pixel canvas (0, 0) is the top-left corner of the canvas.
Some of the pixel canvas drawing routines allows one to draw an image.
However, these routines are not intended for general use: they merely
provide the interface for higher library packages.  Events
(ie. refresh/ resize/ cursor) on the underlying window (i.e. X window)
may be ``pushed'' up into the pixel canvas, where they will be
redistributed to application or library code which has registered an
interest in these events.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00834300000000000000">Refresh and Resize events</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="472">&#160;</A>
<P>
When the underlying window (i.e. X window) needs to be redisplayed or
has resized, the <A NAME="tex2html98" HREF="../lib/kwin.html#kwin_resize"><B>kwin_resize</B></A> routine should be
called. This will send refresh/ resize events to higher levels in the
image display system. If you are using the ``Canvas'' widget (or a
derivative) provided by the Karma widgets library, you don't have to
worry about explicitely calling <A NAME="tex2html99" HREF="../lib/kwin.html#kwin_resize"><B>kwin_resize</B></A>, the
widget does this automatically whenever the window is
refreshed/resized. You can use the
<A NAME="tex2html100" HREF="../lib/kwin.html#kwin_register_refresh_func"><B>kwin_register_refresh_func</B></A> function to register a 
function which will be called whenever a pixel canvas should be
refreshed (redrawn).
<P>
The following code example shows the structure of a refresh
function. All it does is draw a green line diagonally across the
canvas.
<P>
<PRE>void refresh_func (KPixCanvas canvas, int width, int height,
                   void **info, PostScriptPage pspage,
                   unsigned int num_areas,
                   KPixCanvasRefreshArea *areas,
                   flag *honoured_areas)
/*  [SUMMARY] Process a refresh event for a pixel canvas.
    &lt;canvas&gt; The pixel canvas.
    &lt;width&gt; The width of the canvas in pixels.
    &lt;height&gt; The height of the canvas in pixels.
    &lt;info&gt; A pointer to the arbitrary canvas information pointer.
    &lt;pspage&gt; If not NULL, the PostScriptPage object the refresh is
    redirected to.
    &lt;num_areas&gt; The number of areas that need to be refreshed. If this is
    0 then the entire pixel canvas needs to be refreshed.
    &lt;areas&gt; The list of areas that need to be refreshed.
    &lt;honoured_areas&gt; If the value TRUE is written here it is assumed the
    routine honoured the list of refresh areas and did not write outside
    these areas and hence the list of areas will be passed to subsequent
    registered refresh routines. If FALSE is written here (or nothing is
    written here), implying the routine refreshed the entire pixel canvas,
    subsequent refresh routines will be told to refresh the entire canvas.
    [RETURNS] Nothing.

{
    unsigned int pixel_value;

    if ( !kwin_get_colour (canvas, &quot;green&quot;, &amp;pixel_value, NULL, NULL, NULL) )
    {
        fprintf (stderr, &quot;Error getting colour: \"green\"\n&quot;);
        return;
    }
    kwin_draw_line (canvas, 0, 0, width - 1, height - 1, pixel_value);

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00834400000000000000">Input events</A></H3>
<A NAME="sectionkwinevents">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="481">&#160;</A>
<P>
Other events, such as cursor events on the X window are inserted using
the <A NAME="tex2html101" HREF="../lib/kwin.html#kwin_process_position_event"><B>kwin_process_position_event</B></A> function. The
pixel canvas will automatically forward these events to all routines
previously registered to handle these events. The process stops when
the event is consumed by a routine.  In many applications, the higher
levels of the library process these events, so the application
programmer need not write any event processing code. This can save
thousands of lines of code even in a modest application. If you are
using the ``Canvas'' widget (or a derivative) provided by the Karma
widgets library, you don't have to worry about explicitely calling
<A NAME="tex2html102" HREF="../lib/kwin.html#kwin_process_position_event"><B>kwin_process_position_event</B></A>, the widget does this
automatically whenever an event occurs on a window.
<P>
You simply call <A NAME="tex2html103" HREF="../lib/kwin.html#kwin_register_position_event_func"><B>kwin_register_position_event_func</B></A>
if you want to register a function that receives input (position)
events.
<P>
The follow code example shows a simple event handling function (termed
a callback) for a pixel canvas. This function simply prints the
current mouse pointer position when the left mouse button is pressed
down.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00834500000000000000">24bit Support</A></H3>
<P>
There are special attributes associated with each pixel canvas which
must be used when computing pixel values for drawing on canvases with
visual type TrueColour or DirectColour. This paragraph is only of
relevance for TrueColour or DirectColour pixel canvasses.  Those
familiar with Xlib programming will recall that there is a defined
bitmask for red, green and blue for each visual of type TrueColour or
DirectColour. The bits in a pixel value required for full intensity
for a primary colour requires using all the bits of that colour's
bitmask. The colour white is a pixel value that is the OR of all three
bitmasks. The Xlib model allows you to construct pixel values this way
and draw them as required. However, for efficiency reasons, the model
used in the Karma Graphics library is a little more complete. In Karma
the distinction is made between pixel values used in most drawing
operations and those used when drawing images of pixels. Hence a pixel
canvas has the following attributes:
<P>
  red|green|blue pixel masks which should be used except when
                   drawing images
<P>
  red|green|blue image masks which should be used only when drawing
                   images
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00835000000000000000">``kcmap'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The support for dynamic colourmaps is provided by the <A NAME="tex2html104" HREF="../lib/kcmap.html"><B>kcmap</B></A>
package. This is another generic package, portable to non-X
environments. It allows colourmaps to be resized, changed, dynamically
shared across a network as well as reading and writing to disc. See
the chapter on colourmaps for more details.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00836000000000000000">``event'' package</A></H2>
<A NAME="494">&#160;</A>
<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html107" HREF="../lib/event.html"><B>event</B></A> package provides a mechanism for graphics events
to be sent to other programmes. This should not be confused with the
event dispatching mechanism in the
<A HREF="node8.html#sectionkwinevents"><A NAME="tex2html105" HREF="../lib/kwin.html"><B>kwin</B></A></A> package, which descibes
events <EM>within</EM> a single programme. The <A NAME="tex2html108" HREF="../lib/event.html"><B>event</B></A> package
distributes events to other programmes over network connections, and
depends on the
<A HREF="node5.html#chapterinterprocesscommunications">interprocess communications</A>
support in the Karma library. This package is useful if you want to
capture events from an existing visualisation tool such as
<B>&lt;kvis&gt;</B> in another programme.
<P>
The package defines the ``generic_event'' protocol with the
<A NAME="tex2html109" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package. A server is the programme which
dispatches events to ``generic_event'' clients. Usually, you don't
have to worry about writing server support, as that has already been
done inside the standard visualisation tools. Most programmers will be
interested in how to write a client.
<P>
Clients specify which events they wish to receive from the server by
specifying a bitmask. Table <A NAME="tex2html110" HREF="../lib/event.html#event_MASKS"><B>event_MASKS</B></A> defines the
mask values. Clients will only receive the type of events specified in
the the bitmask.
<P>
There are two basic modes in which a client can communicate with the
server. One is <EM>blocking</EM> and the other is <EM>asynchronous</EM>.
These are described below.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00836100000000000000">Blocking Mode</A></H3>
<P>
This involves the client waiting (blocking) for a single event from a
specified server. Any events in the server will not be sent to the
client unless the client is waiting. The client waits for an event by
calling <A NAME="tex2html111" HREF="../lib/event.html#event_wait"><B>event_wait</B></A>. Once the client has received the
event, the server will no longer send events. This mode of operation
is useful for simple mainline programmes (i.e. non event-driven) which
only occasionally want to look for an event. A disadvantage of this
mode is if the server is generating events very quickly, the client
can miss some.
<P>
The following example code shows a client connecting to the
<B>&lt;kvis&gt;</B> programme on the local machine, capturing a number
of keypress events. The client is operating in blocking mode.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00836200000000000000">Asynchronous Mode</A></H3>

This is used for event-driven clients (such as visualisation

<A NAME="tex2html112" HREF="../lib/event.html#event_register_event_func"><B>event_register_event_func</B></A> to register an
application function that is called whenever a new event is received

set the event mask for a specific server or all servers. This mode of
operation is more efficient and does not suffer from the event loss
problem. The disadvantage is that the client has to relinquish control
of its main loop to the Karma event management system (provided by the
<A NAME="tex2html114" HREF="../lib/dm.html"><B>dm</B></A> package) or some other co-operating event management
system (such as that provided by the Xt library).

<P>
The next level up in the image display system is the <A NAME="tex2html117" HREF="../lib/canvas.html"><B>canvas</B></A>
package. It defines a world canvas class. A world canvas is similar to
a pixel canvas, however, drawing operations are specified in world
co-ordinates, rather than pixel co-ordinates. For example, a pixel
canvas might be 512*512 pixels. A world canvas may map this to a
simple unit canvas from (0.0, 0.0) to (1.0, 1.0).  A world canvas is
created from a pixel canvas.
<P>
The origin of a world canvas is the bottom-left corner of the canvas.
Note how this differs with the pixel canvas. The pixel canvas is a
nearly direct mapping onto the underlying graphics system. The world
canvas is modelled on a standard cartesian co-ordinate system. A
linear transformation is applied when converting between pixel and
world co-ordinates. If a non-linear world co-ordinate system is
required, the <A NAME="tex2html118" HREF="../lib/canvas.html#canvas_register_transforms_func"><B>canvas_register_transforms_func</B></A>
routine may be used to register co-ordinate conversion routines. Note,
however, that when drawing into a world canvas, the co-ordinates (or
offsets: radii) specified in the function call are transformed into
pixel co-ordinates and a similarly shaped object is drawn into the
underlying pixel canvas. Thus, an ellipse draw in a world canvas
appears as an ellipse, irrespective of the co-ordinate transformation
specified.
<P>
The world canvas package also provides drawing routines allowing one
to draw an image. However, these routines are not intended for general
use: it merely provides the interface for higher library packages.
The <A NAME="tex2html119" HREF="../lib/canvas.html"><B>canvas</B></A> package allows 2-D image edit instructions to be

package. This makes the process of drawing objects (i.e. filled
ellipses, polygons) in world co-ordinates a trivial task.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION008310000000000000000">``viewimg'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The most important package (as far as the application programmer is
concerned) is the <A NAME="tex2html121" HREF="../lib/viewimg.html"><B>viewimg</B></A> package. This defines a viewable
image class. A viewable image may be created from a plane of an n-D
Karma array, or from a 2-D Intelligent Array. A viewable image is
associated with one world canvas. Each world canvas may have many
viewable images associated with it. A viewable image contains a
reference to the 2-D data array. It is this data array which is easily
filled by the application programmer. All the mechanics of determining
how to refresh, resize, zoom the image display are handled by the
<A NAME="tex2html122" HREF="../lib/viewimg.html"><B>viewimg</B></A> package. This greatly simplifies the implementation
of panning and zooming. Window refresh and resize events for viewable
images are handled <EM>entirely</EM> inside the library, leaving the
programmer free to concentrate on the data to be displayed, rather
than having to cope with a cumbersome event driven system. This does
not preclude the registration of other routines to process events on
the underlying world and pixel canvases.
<P>
An example of where a world canvas would have a refresh/ resize
routine registered is when graphic overlays on an image are desired
(however, there is also library support for maintaining overlay lists
to make this simpler too).
<P>
The application programmer may update the data array at will, and,
using the <A NAME="tex2html123" HREF="../lib/viewimg.html#viewimg_register_data_change"><B>viewimg_register_data_change</B></A> function,
update the window display with the new image. Just as simply, the
<A NAME="tex2html124" HREF="../lib/viewimg.html#viewimg_make_active"><B>viewimg_make_active</B></A> function may be used to select
which viewable image should be displayed in a world canvas: this is
termed making the viewable image &quot;active&quot;.  This makes the
implementation of a movie loop trivial. Nor is there any penalty for
using the layers of image display support in Karma: frame rates of
over 10 frames per second (512*512*8bit) on conventional SUN IPCs,
without graphics accelerators, have been attained.
<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html125" HREF="../lib/viewimg.html"><B>viewimg</B></A> package allows 2-D image edit instructions to be
drawn onto a viewable image. This means that the original 2-D data
array is modified and the viewable image is redisplayed. Thus writing
a painting and image editing application becomes far simpler.  These
features interface directly onto the <A NAME="tex2html126" HREF="../lib/iedit.html"><B>iedit</B></A> package. Because
of this integration, the networking support built into the
<A NAME="tex2html127" HREF="../lib/iedit.html"><B>iedit</B></A> package allows one to easily implement a ``shared
whiteboard'' application, a research topic in collaboration
technology.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION008311000000000000000">``overlay'' package</A></H2>
<P>
Another important package is the <A NAME="tex2html128" HREF="../lib/overlay.html"><B>overlay</B></A> package. This
manages overlay lists (lists of geometric objects). Each overlay
object is defined in (possibly mixed) co-ordinates, and may be
selectively moved or removed. Overlay lists may be shared between
modules (using the ``2D_overlay'' connection protocol). Each overlay
list may be associated with multiple world canvases. When the canvas
is refreshed, any associated overlay lists will be automatically
redrawn. By using the restriction specification mechanisms, a single
overlay list can have objects which apply to all frames of a movie
(when using the <A NAME="tex2html129" HREF="../lib/viewimg.html"><B>viewimg</B></A> package) or to a single
frame. Hence, from frame to frame, a different set of overlay objects
is automatically drawn.
<P>
Mixing of co-ordinate types can be very powerful. For example, you may
place a line with one end specified by relative co-ordinates and the
other in world co-ordinates. This would allow you to have a line which
was fixed to some convenient position in the canvas at one end, and
the other end would be placed near some feature of interest.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION008312000000000000000">``contour'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html130" HREF="../lib/contour.html"><B>contour</B></A> package provides a similar interface as the
<A NAME="tex2html131" HREF="../lib/viewimg.html"><B>viewimg</B></A> package, except that 2-D array data is displayed as
contours rather than a bitmapped image. This package is designed to
have an almost identical interface to the <A NAME="tex2html132" HREF="../lib/viewimg.html"><B>viewimg</B></A> package so
that little distinction is made between the two different methods of
displaying 2-D array data.
<P>

<P>
A quite powerful image display tool is <B>&lt;kvis&gt;</B>. The power
user is urged to use this module and then read the source code to see
how much functionality may be packed into so few lines of code, using
the image display support in the Karma library. An entire chapter is
devoted to a simple image display tool (this uses Karma widgets and is
less then 500 lines long), so you are urged to read this.
