<H1><A NAME="SECTION001900000000000000000">Internals of the Karma Data Format</A></H1>
<P>
The Karma data format is generally meant to be hidden from the
programmer. More friendly interfaces such as
<A HREF="node11.html#chapteriarray">Intelligent Arrays</A> provide easy ways to create
and manipulate multidimensional data arrays. This chapter is aimed at
people who are developing interfaces between Karma and another
package. One of the great strengths of Karma is that you don't have to
be taken over completely just because you want to use a few bits of
it. While Karma does provide a complete working environment, unlike
some other large packages it does not insist that you immerse yourself
in it.
<P>
Many people are justifably only interested in the Karma graphics and
widget libraries, since they already have an environment in which to
manipulate data. An example of this is <B>perlDL</B> (Perl Data
Language), originally developed by Karl Glazebrook
(<A NAME="tex2html288" HREF="mailto:kgb@aaoepp.aao.gov.au">kgb@aaoepp.aao.gov.au</A>) and has attracted a strong
following. The perlDL environment provides powerful array manipulation
in an interactive environment, but lacks a built-in data display
facility (it does contain modules to send data to image display tools
like SAOimage or Karma visualisation tools). In such an environment,
it is desirable to be able to use the Karma graphics and widget
libraries directly from within the intepreter, without loosing control
to Karma.
<P>
The Karma data format may be thought of as a mechanism to describe the
way data is stored in virtual memory. Naturally, functions are
provided to translate between virtual memory data and permanent
storage and to move data between different computers, although these
functions are probably not of interest unless you want to specifically
write or read in Karma format. This chapter will discuss the virtual
memory layout of Karma data structures.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001910000000000000000">Description of the Karma Data Structure</A></H1>
<P>
This section gives an overview of the Karma data structure and
introduces some of the terms and concepts.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001911000000000000000">Elements</A></H2>
<P>
The fundamental building block for Karma data is the the <B>
element</B>. An element may fall into one of two classes: either <EM>
named</EM> or <EM>unnamed</EM> elements. Unnamed elements are references to
other Karma data structures, such as multi-dimensional arrays or
linked lists. Named elements are further subclassed into <EM>atomic</EM>
and <EM>non-atomic</EM> elements. Atomic elements include the basic C
language datatypes (such as float, int, double and so on) as well as
complex versions of C datatypes (the real and imaginary components are
adjacent in memory, with the real component residing in lower
memory). Non-atomic datatypes are somewhat more complicated datatypes
such as variable-length strings or fixed-length strings. See Figure
<A HREF="node19.html#figelementclasses">B.1</A> for a class heirarchy of elements.
<P>
<P><A NAME="2118">&#160;</A><A NAME="figelementclasses">&#160;</A><BR>
<STRONG>Figure B.1:</STRONG> Element Class Heirarchy<BR>
<P><H3><A NAME="SECTION001911100000000000000">Element Descriptors</A></H3>
<P>
Elements have descriptors associated with them which are used to partly
describe them. For a named element, the descriptor is simply a string
which contains the name. For unnamed elements, the descriptor is
either an array descriptor (for elements which point to an array), or
a linked list (packet) descriptor (for elements which point to a
linked list).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION001911200000000000000">Element Data</A></H3>
<P>
The element data for an atomic element is the memory storage for the
data itself. For variable-length strings the element data is a pointer
to the string. For fixed-length string the element data is a <TT>
FString</TT> structure. For array pointers the data is a structure
containing a pointer to the start of the array and other
information. For list pointers the data is a pointer to a linked list
header. See Figure <A HREF="node19.html#figelementdata">B.2</A>.
<P>
<P><A NAME="2129">&#160;</A><A NAME="figelementdata">&#160;</A><BR>
<STRONG>Figure B.2:</STRONG> Element Data<BR>
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION001912000000000000000">Packets</A></H2>
<P>
The recursive nature of the Karma data structure is due to the use of
<B>packets</B>. A packet is a contiguous block of one or more
elements, with no padding between the elements. The elements in a
packet may be of any type.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001913000000000000000">Arrays</A></H2>
<P>
Karma supports multi-dimensional arrays of packets. Because the arrays
are composed of packets rather than atomic elements, it is possible to
create data structures which are arrays of linked lists, or arrays
with subarrays. Building a heirarchical data structure like this
allows you to place data at many levels, for instance, a
three-dimensional array which is structured as a one-dimensional array
of packets, with each packet containing an atomic element (perhaps a
scaling factor) and a pointer to a two-dimensional array. Such a
structure allows you to define varying scaling factors for an
array. There is no limit to the complexity you can create.
<P>
In practice, most array packets have only one atomic element, since
that is the kind of data most people have. Sometimes arrays have three
elements: ``Red Intensity'', ``Green Intensity'' and ``Blue
Intensity'' (for TrueColour or so-called ``24bit'' images), but this
is about as complicated it gets.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION001913100000000000000">Array Descriptors</A></H3>
<P>
An array descriptor describes the construction of a multi-dimensional
array of packets. As well as containing a pointer to a packet
descriptor, it also contains an array of pointers to dimension
descriptors. Array descriptors also provide a field into which address
offset arrays may be placed. These are usually created by the
<A NAME="tex2html291" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_compute_array_offsets"><B>ds_compute_array_offsets</B></A> function. The array
descriptor also provides for describing a tiling mechanism. A <EM>
tiling level</EM> of 0 indicates the array is untiled.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION001913200000000000000">Dimension Descriptors</A></H3>
<P>
A dimension descriptor describes a dimension in an array. It contains
a length field, a name field (all dimensions are uniquely named) as
well as world co-ordinate information. By default, co-ordinates are
linear, so all that is needed to describe the co-ordinate system for
the dimension is the co-ordinate for the first index along the
dimension and the co-ordinate for the last index. A non-linear
co-ordinate system with <EM>separable co-ordinates</EM> is supported by
providing a co-ordinate array. The only restriction on the
co-ordinates in a co-ordinate array is that they are either
monotonically increasing or decreasing. Random co-ordinates are not
supported. Furthermore, in co-ordinate systems where the dimensions
are not seperable (such as most projections of the astronomical RA,DEC
co-ordinate system), the co-ordinate system supported by dimension
descriptors is insufficient. For these co-ordinate systems a separate
mechanism is supplied via the <A NAME="tex2html292" HREF="../lib/wcs.html"><B>wcs</B></A> package.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION001913300000000000000">Array Data</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="2143">&#160;</A><A NAME="2144">&#160;</A>
<P>
The element data for a multi-dimensional array consists of a pointer
to the start of the array data, a function to call when the array data
is to be freed, and an arbitrary pointer to pass to the free
function. This allows enormous flexibility in allocation/deallocation
strategies, without the need for explicit support from within the
Karma library. Routines such as as
<A NAME="tex2html293" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_easy_alloc_array_desc"><B>ds_easy_alloc_array_desc</B></A> and
<A NAME="tex2html294" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_easy_alloc_array_from_array_desc"><B>ds_easy_alloc_array_from_array_desc</B></A> may be used
to ``wrap'' an externally allocated array when you fill an
<TT>array_pointer</TT> structure yourself. You can even allocate data in
shared memory, either using the <A NAME="tex2html295" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_alloc_shm_array"><B>ds_alloc_shm_array</B></A>
function, or filling in an <TT>array_pointer</TT> structure yourself.
Figure <A HREF="node19.html#figelementdata">B.2</A> shows the element data for an array.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001914000000000000000">Linked Lists</A></H2>
<P>
Karma also provides a doubly-linked list mechanism. Linked lists are
convenient when you will be periodically adding data and don't know
beforehand how much data you will end up with. Karma linked lists are
simply linked lists of packets.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION001914100000000000000">Linked List Descriptors</A></H3>
<P>
Since a linked list is just a list of packets, the descriptor for a
linked list is an ordinary packet descriptor.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION001914200000000000000">Linked List Data</A></H3>
<P>
The element data for a linked list is a pointer to a linked list
header. This header contains fields indicating the length of the list,
how the list has been sorted and fields referring to the list
data. The data for a linked list comes in two parts: a contiguous and
a fragmented section. The contiguous section is a contiguous block of
list packets, and comes logically ``before'' the fragmented
section. The rest of the list data is kept in a conventional
doubly-linked list structure, with the list header containing a
pointer to the first and last entries in the fragmented list. The
reason for supporting the arrangement of data in these two ways is to
save virtual memory space as well as performance. When a Karma file is
read into virtual memory, it is already known how long the list will
be, so a contiguous block of entries is allocated. It is much faster
to allocate a single large block of virtual memory than to allocate a
large number of small blocks. In some cases it is more convenient to
deal with a contiguous block of data, and other cases it is more
convenient to deal with a doubly-linked (fragmented) list. The
<A NAME="tex2html296" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_list_unfragment"><B>ds_list_unfragment</B></A> and
<A NAME="tex2html297" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_list_fragment"><B>ds_list_fragment</B></A> functions allow you to convert a
list to either form.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001915000000000000000">General Data Structure</A></H2>
<P>
The recursive nature of the Karma data structure may leave you
wondering where it all starts? Part of the answer is the <B>General
Data Structure</B>, which is a top-level packet descriptor and its
matching (single) packet. Karma imposes the restriction that all names
(i.e. dimension names and element names for named elements) in a
General Data Structure are unique.
<P>
It is possible to create a General Data Structure which has two (or
more) elements in its top-level packet, each which is an array
pointer. You could have two arrays, with possibly different shapes,
in a single General Data Structure. More commonly, you may want to
have a top-level packet with a single array pointer but with many
named elements. This is a simple way of describing FITS-style data:
the array corresponds to the FITS array and the named elements
correspond to the FITS keywords.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001916000000000000000">multi_array structures</A></H2>
<P>
The highest level in the Karma data structure is provided by the <TT>
multi_array</TT> structure. This supports one or more General Data
Structures (sometimes confusingly referred to as <B>arrays</B>). In the
case where the <TT>multi_array</TT> contains more than one General Data
Structure, each is uniquely named. The namespace for each General Data
Structure is separate. The <TT>multi_array</TT> structure provides a
mechanism to package several data structures together into a single
file. This is typically used to package a colourtable together with a
multi-dimensional array.
<P>
The <TT>multi_array</TT> structure also provides the means to manage the
creation, use and destruction of data structures. Packages like the
<A NAME="tex2html298" HREF="../lib/iarray.html"><B>iarray</B></A> package will increment the <EM>attachment</EM> counter
on a <TT>multi_array</TT> structure when they create their own ``view''
into the data. Every time the <A NAME="tex2html299" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_dealloc_multi"><B>ds_dealloc_multi</B></A>
function is called, the attachment count is decremented. Only when it
reaches 0 is the data structure destroyed. The other mechanism
provided by the <A NAME="tex2html300" HREF="../lib/ds.html"><B>ds</B></A> package is a list of destroy callbacks
attached to the <TT>multi_array</TT> structure. This is another way to
manage data structures which are a view into the <TT>multi_array</TT>
data, but in a more self-contained way (perhaps used in the internals
of a widget). In most cases, the attachment mechanism is more
convenient, since it does not require you to deal with cleaning up
properly when a <TT>multi_array</TT> data structure is destroyed: data
is only destroyed when nobody is interested in it any more.
<P>
Finally, the <TT>multi_array</TT> structure contains a mechanism to
record ``history'' information. These are just human-readable comments
that are appended to a file which describe how the data has been
processed. The history is usually manipulated with the
<A NAME="tex2html301" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_history_append_string"><B>ds_history_append_string</B></A> function.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001920000000000000000">Creating Your Own Karma Data Structure</A></H1>
<P>
This section discusses how to create your own Karma data structure, or
how you might wrap your own data structure in a Karma data
structure. Wrapping your own data structure is basically a matter of
creating the correct Karma data structure descriptors: it doesn't
affect your data, but it does allow you to use Karma functions to use
and manipulate your data.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001921000000000000000">Creating an Ordinary Array</A></H2>
<P>
The simplest interface available is the
<A NAME="tex2html302" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_easy_alloc_array"><B>ds_easy_alloc_array</B></A> function. This will create a
multi-dimensional array of uni-variate data (i.e. an ordinary array
where each point in the array contains a single value). This function
yields a pointer to the beginning of the array and a handle to a <TT>
multi_array</TT> descriptor. This interface is not commonly used outside
the Karma environment, since the <A NAME="tex2html303" HREF="../lib/iarray.html"><B>iarray</B></A> package provides a
much simpler and more powerful interface for creation and manipulation
of multi-dimensional data. The array is allocated from ordinary
virtual memory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001922000000000000000">Creating an Array in Shared Memory</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="2188">&#160;</A><A NAME="2189">&#160;</A>
<P>
If you wanted to create an array using shared memory, you need to make
a few function calls. While slightly more complicated, the advantage
of shared memory is that if you subsequently transmit the array to
another process on the same computer using Karma connections, the
array data does not actually need to be transferred. What happens is
that the destination process receives a handle to the same array
data. This makes the cost of transferring array data essentially
zero. Karma also supports auto-creation of files which are then memory
mapped as an alternative mechanism for sharing arrays between
processes. The following code first attempts to create a SysV shared
memory array (by calling <A NAME="tex2html304" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_alloc_shm_array"><B>ds_alloc_shm_array</B></A>) and
if that fails it attempts to create a memory mapped file (by calling
<A NAME="tex2html305" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_alloc_mmap_array"><B>ds_alloc_mmap_array</B></A>).
<P>
Below is some sample code which creates a two-dimensional array
(128x128) of floating-point data in shared memory and then obtains the
pointer to the start of the array data. Error checking has been
omitted in order to aid clarity.
<P>
<PRE>unsigned int type = K_FLOAT;
char *array;
array_pointer arrayp;
array_desc *arr_desc;
multi_array *multi_desc;
uaddr lengths[2];
CONST char *elem_name = &quot;Data Value&quot;;

lengths[0] = 128;
lengths[1] = 128;
arr_desc = ds_easy_alloc_array_desc (2, lengths, NULL, NULL, NULL,
                                     NULL, 1, &amp;type, &amp;elem_name);
if ( !ds_alloc_shm_array (&amp;arrayp, arr_desc, TRUE, TRUE) &amp;&amp;
     !ds_alloc_mmap_array (-1, 0, 0, TRUE, &amp;arrayp, arr_desc, TRUE, TRUE) )
    exit (1);
multi_desc = ds_easy_alloc_array_from_array_desc (arr_desc, &amp;arrayp, FALSE);
array = arrayp.array;</PRE>
<P>
In the following example the code falls back to ordinary virtual
memory if the shared memory allocation failed. Once again error
checking has been omitted for the sake of clarity.
<P>
<PRE>unsigned int type = K_FLOAT;
char *array;
array_pointer arrayp;
array_desc *arr_desc;
multi_array *multi_desc;
uaddr lengths[2];
CONST char *elem_name = &quot;Data Value&quot;;

lengths[0] = 128;
lengths[1] = 128;
arr_desc = ds_easy_alloc_array_desc (2, lengths, NULL, NULL, NULL,
                                     NULL, 1, &amp;type, &amp;elem_name);
if ( !ds_alloc_shm_array (&amp;arrayp, arr_desc, TRUE, FALSE) &amp;&amp;
     !ds_alloc_mmap_array (-1, 0, 0, TRUE, &amp;arrayp, arr_desc, TRUE, FALSE) &amp;&amp;
     !ds_alloc_vm_array (&amp;arrayp, arr_desc, TRUE, FALSE) )
    exit (2);
multi_desc = ds_easy_alloc_array_from_array_desc (arr_desc, &amp;arrayp, FALSE);
array = arrayp.array;</PRE>
<P>
Here you can see that if the shared memory or memory mapped allocation
fails, the <A NAME="tex2html306" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_alloc_vm_array"><B>ds_alloc_vm_array</B></A> function is called to
allocate ordinary virtual memory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001923000000000000000">Wrapping Ordinary Arrays</A></H2>
<P>
If you had your own array of data that you wanted to wrap in a Karma
data structure, you would probably use the
<A NAME="tex2html307" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_wrap_preallocated_n_element_array"><B>ds_wrap_preallocated_n_element_array</B></A> which will
take a pointer to your data and creates a <TT>multi_array</TT>
descriptor. Of course, you have to supply some extra parameters to
describe how your data is arranged. This function assumes that the
data is contained in ordinary virtual memory. Note that it would be
quite valid to use this function for an array which resides in shared
memory, but then Karma would not know this and not be able to take
advantage of this. In which case there probably wasn't any point to
creating a shared memory array in the first place.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001924000000000000000">Wrapping Shared Memory Arrays</A></H2>
<P>
This is similar to the example of creating an array in shared memory
(above), but instead of making a call to
<A NAME="tex2html308" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_alloc_shm_array"><B>ds_alloc_shm_array</B></A> you would need to fill in the
contents of an <TT>array_pointer</TT> structure yourself. You should
look at the Karma header files for the definition of this structure,
as well as the magic constants. The structure definition is fully
commented, so it should be clear what you need to do. A code extract
from the <A NAME="tex2html309" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_alloc_shm_array"><B>ds_alloc_shm_array</B></A> function at the time
of writing is given below.
<P>
<PRE>arrayp-&gt;array = addr;
arrayp-&gt;free = ( void (*) (void *) ) m_shm_detach;
arrayp-&gt;info = addr;
arrayp-&gt;mem_type = K_ARRAY_MEM_TYPE_SHM;
arrayp-&gt;u.shm.shmid = shmid;
arrayp-&gt;u.shm.base = addr;</PRE>
<P>
Here the <TT>addr</TT> variable contains the pointer to the start of the
shared memory segment and the <TT>shmid</TT> variable contains the shared
memory ID. Note how the <TT>free</TT> member function is defined: this
will be called when the Karma data structure is deallocated. You may
substitute your own function here, or write a <TT>NULL</TT> to indicate
that no action should be taken to deallocate the shared memory. This
gives you complete flexibility in allocating and deallocating array
data.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001925000000000000000">Wrapping Memory Mapped Arrays</A></H2>
<P>
This is similar to the example of creating an array in mapped memory
(above), but instead of making a call to
<A NAME="tex2html310" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_alloc_mmap_array"><B>ds_alloc_mmap_array</B></A> you would need to fill in the
contents of an <TT>array_pointer</TT> structure yourself. A code extract
from the <A NAME="tex2html311" HREF="../lib/ds.html#ds_alloc_mmap_array"><B>ds_alloc_mmap_array</B></A> function at the time
of writing is given below.
<P>
<PRE>arrayp-&gt;array = addr;
arrayp-&gt;mem_type = K_ARRAY_MEM_TYPE_MMAP;
arrayp-&gt;u.mmap.fd = fd;
arrayp-&gt;u.mmap.size = size;
arrayp-&gt;u.mmap.base = addr;</PRE>
<P>
Here the <TT>addr</TT> variable contains the pointer to the start of the
mapped file, the <TT>fd</TT> variable is the open file and the <TT>size</TT>
variable is the size of the mapped region (this may be larger than the
actual array storage requirements).
