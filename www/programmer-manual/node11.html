<P>
The name ``iarray'' is a contraction of ``Intelligent Array'', which
is supposed to describe the power of these arrays. Iarrays are
n-dimensional arrays similar to ordinary C arrays, but have the
following advantages:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> They are dynamically allocated. This is one of their biggest
advantages over ordinary C arrays. Dynamically allocating arrays in C
normally requires the user to either be very clever in the method of
allocation, or to do a multiplication at every element access
(assuming a 2D array). Iarrays use double indirection to allow for an
efficient and neat accessing scheme. This method also allows for
interesting mappings of the iarray, such as taking real subarrays, or
mapping an array onto a torus efficiently.
<LI> They know their own size. This removes the necessity for passing
in dimension lengths to functions which take arrays as
arguments. <A NAME="tex2html149" HREF="../lib/iarray.html#iarray_dim_length"><B>iarray_dim_length</B></A> allows you to query
an array for one of it's dimension lengths.
<LI> They can do run time bounds checking. If you compile with
``-DDEBUG'' all element accesses will be bounds and type checked. This
is somewhat slower than normal, but the implementation is such that
without bounds checking there is no performance penalty over C arrays.
<LI> They can have named attachments. Using
<A NAME="tex2html150" HREF="../lib/iarray.html#iarray_put_float"><B>iarray_put_float</B></A> and
<A NAME="tex2html151" HREF="../lib/iarray.html#iarray_get_float"><B>iarray_get_float</B></A>, named floating point values can
be attached to and retrieved from an iarray. There are corresponding
functions for attaching ints and strings, and a pair of generic
functions for handling other data types. This is very useful when
writing iarrays to disk or to a connection, as attachments are also
transferred. Attachments are often thought of as ``keyword-value''
pairs in the ``header of a data file.
<LI> They can be written to a disk or connection very easily, and are
written in the Karma data format, which ensures portability across a
wide range of platforms, and ease of use with Karma modules.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
They have the following disadvantages:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> They use an unusual syntax for accessing elements. This is
actually not such a problem, as in my opinion the syntax (once you get
used to it) enhances the readability of the code, by always showing
the type of the array being accessed. The syntax is described below.
<LI> Currently, simple methods are in place for working with arrays
of one two, three or four dimensions, comprised of floats, ints,
unsigned ints, bytes (chars) or unsigned bytes. Using other types is a
fairly trivial matter, requiring only some new macros in
&lt;karma_iarray.h&gt;, but using arrays of more dimensions also
requires a generic function to be written for accessing elements of
such arrays.  This is still not terribly complex, but I hope to remove
this requirement at some later stage.
<P>
</UL><H1><A NAME="SECTION001120000000000000000">Syntax</A></H1>
<P>
There is only one real oddity about iarrays, and that is the way
individual elements of the array are accessed. Element access is done
with a function notation, although normally a macro actually does the
work for performance reasons. Functions are used when -DDEBUG is used
on the command line. The element access function names are based on
the type of the elements in the array, and the number of dimensions.
Thus, given a two dimensional floating point array called ``a'', to
access element [i][j], you use the notation <TT>F2(a,i,j)</TT>. A few of
the macros are listed below to give you an idea of the format:
<P>
<PRE>Access macro            Type                            Number of dimensions
B1  (a, x)              signed byte                     1
F1  (a, x)              floating point                  1
UB2 (a, y, x)           unsigned byte                   2
US2 (a, y, x)           unsigned short                  2
D3  (a, z, y, x)        double precision floating point 3
I4  (a, z, y, x, w)     signed integer                  4
UI4 (a, z, y, x, w)     unsigned integer                4</PRE>
<P>
where &lt;a&gt; is the Iarray, &lt;z&gt;, &lt;y&gt;, &lt;x&gt; and &lt;w&gt; are
indices along each dimension.
<P>
As mentioned above, this notation is currently available for arrays of
one, two, three or four dimensions, with float, int, byte or unsigned
byte elements. If other dimensions or types are required, macros
should be written to handle these, and possibly function calls
also. See &lt;karma_iarray.h&gt; for macros.
<P>
It is important to remember that the type ``iarray'' is a generic
type: it has no size, dimensionality or type. However, once you create
or get (read) an iarray and assign it to an instance of an ``iarray''
type, that instance is a pointer to an Intelligent Array which has a
specific dimensionality, size and type. All the library routines can
handle Iarrays of any type and size, and many can handle Iarrays of
any dimensionality. However, when it comes to your own code which
accesses Iarrays, the access macro you use <B>MUST</B> match the type
and dimensionality of the Iarray you read/created.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001130000000000000000">Allocating</A></H1>
<P>
An iarray must be allocated before it can be used. The simplest method
is to use <A NAME="tex2html152" HREF="../lib/iarray.html#iarray_create_2D"><B>iarray_create_2D</B></A> (or the corresponding
1D, 3D or 4D versions), which takes the lengths of the dimensions and
the type of the elements as parameters, and returns an iarray. So for
example, to make ``a'' an m by n floating point array, use:
<P>
<PRE>iarray a;
a = iarray_create_2D (m, n, K_FLOAT);</PRE>
<P>
The space allocated for an iarray remains allocated until specifically
deallocated using <A NAME="tex2html153" HREF="../lib/iarray.html#iarray_dealloc"><B>iarray_dealloc</B></A>. Think of an array
as a pointer, just as you would an ordinary dynamically allocated
array.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001140000000000000000">Disks and Connections</A></H1>
<P>
One of the main benefits of iarrays and the karma library is the
simplicity with which they can be written to disk or connections.  The
karma data format is portable across platforms, so the problems of
endianness and size of types is removed from the application
programmer.
<P>
An iarray can be written to disk with the function
<A NAME="tex2html154" HREF="../lib/iarray.html#iarray_write"><B>iarray_write</B></A> which requires only the iarray to write, and
the name of the disk file. If the name given for the file is
``connections'', then the iarray is written over any open connections
(see the documentation for Karma communications to find out how to
make iarray connections).
<P>
Iarrays are read using the <A NAME="tex2html155" HREF="../lib/iarray.html#iarray_read_nD"><B>iarray_read_nD</B></A> function,
which takes a number of parameters, most of which can (fortunately) be
ignored in most cases. I normally use the following:
<P>
<TT>a = iarray_read_nD (fname, FALSE, NULL, n, NULL, NULL,
K_CH_MAP_NEVER);</TT>
<P>
Using this as a model, you merely need to provide the filename (a
string), and the expected number of dimensions (e.g. 2 for an image).
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001150000000000000000">Functions on iarrays</A></H1>
<P>
An assortment of functions are provided by the Karma library for doing
various work on iarrays. For example, there are functions to find the
minimum and maximum values, to fill the array with some value, and to
perform element-wise arithmetic on arrays. These functions should be
used whenever possible, as they are generally tested to be correct
(let us know if they aren't), perform error checking, and are highly
optimised on some platforms.
<P>
If you create any functions that you feel are of great general
interest, please mail them to ``karma-suggestions@atnf.csiro.au''.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001160000000000000000">Example</A></H1>
<P>
The following is a simple example program showing how iarrays are used
in practice. It creates an iarray with the multiplication table in it,
reads another iarray from disk, and adds one to the other element
wise. It then writes the resulting array to disk.
