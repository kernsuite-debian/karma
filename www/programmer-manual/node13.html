<H1><A NAME="SECTION001300000000000000000">Multi-Threading</A></H1>
<P>
In this document the term ``threading'' is equivalent to
``parallelisation''.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001310000000000000000">Purpose</A></H1>
<P>
Broadly speaking, there are two main approaches to making use of
parallelism:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> divide the application into a number of smaller &quot;jobs&quot; and run
each job on a separate CPU
<LI> let the compiler parallelise the code for you.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
The former approach is the more traditional, since, until recently,
compiler technology did not generally support parallelism. It is the
approach of ``hand tuning''.
<P>
There is an increasing push to use compilers to parallelise code.
However, while appealing to the application programmer, current
attempts at automated parallelisation of code generally fall far
behind the performance of ``hand tuned'' parallel code.
<P>
The Karma library attempts to solve the first approach so that the
application programmer spends the least time necessary in ``hand
tuning'' code. It does this in two ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> provides a simple, efficient and uniform interface to threading
libraries by implementing a ``job launching'' facility
<LI> internal parallelisation of CPU intensive routines in the
library.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Clearly, if an application makes heavy use of CPU intensive routines
in the Karma library, the benefits gained from a multi-CPU platform
are automatically gained without the need for any intervention by the
application programmer.
<P>
Of greater interest is the support provided for the application
programmer to parallelise code. This is all provided by the
<A NAME="tex2html164" HREF="../lib/mt.html"><B>mt</B></A> package. The <A NAME="tex2html165" HREF="../lib/mt.html"><B>mt</B></A> package allows the
application programmer to create a pool of threads onto which jobs may
be launched. Even if a platform does not support multi-threading, the
same interface may still be used (without any significant performance
penalty).
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001320000000000000000">Overview</A></H1>
<P>
To make use of multi-threading, you first need to create a pool of
threads onto which you can launch jobs. This is done by calling
<A NAME="tex2html167" HREF="../lib/mt.html#mt_create_pool"><B>mt_create_pool</B></A>.  You may then launch jobs onto the
thread pool by calling <A NAME="tex2html168" HREF="../lib/mt.html#mt_launch_job"><B>mt_launch_job</B></A>. It is
important to understand the distinction between threads and jobs:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Threads are not destroyed (unless their pool is explicitely
destroyed by <A NAME="tex2html166" HREF="../lib/mt.html#mt_destroy_pool"><B>mt_destroy_pool</B></A>). Threads sit idle
until they are given a job.
<LI> Jobs are just that: a job that must be done. It corresponds to a
function that is called by the thread it runs on. They last a short
time and are run on the first available idle thread. The actual
execution order of jobs is unpredictable. Typically an algorithm
divides up the work to be done and has one job function which is
launched many times, once for each part of the work.
<LI> You may launch many more (or less) jobs than there are
threads. Often it is not convenient to divide the work into N pieces
(where N is the number of threads), and may actually be less efficient
(the last thread may end up doing more work than others). It is
usually better to divide the work into far more jobs than there are
threads. This ensures that all threads are kept busy (this is termed
``load balancing'').
<P>
</UL>
<P>
You may require that each thread has a private working space (other
than the stack) which is available to the jobs that run on that
thread. This private data is ``remembered'' for all the jobs run on
the thread, and is a convenient way to merge the results of different
jobs together.
<P>
One of the more common traps in threads programming is the incorrect
use of global data. In particular, where more than one thread (or job)
may update data which is not private to that thread. Examples of this
kind of data are global variables and static variables inside
functions. Because a function may be running more than once at the
same time, you cannot update static variables in these functions if
they are called from within a job function. Of course, reading global
or function static data is not a problem. The problem occurs when
updates are made. Instead use automatic variables (which go on the
stack) and the thread-private working space discussed above.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001330000000000000000">Classes of threaded algorithms</A></H1>
<P>
The simplest class of threaded algorithm is where the next iteration
of the algorithm does not depend on any previous results. An example
of this is where two arrays are added together element-wise and stored
in a third array. This algorithm is the simplest to thread: simply
replace the outermost iteration loop with a loop which launches each
iteration as a job. Each job will be run on any available thread,
making maximum use of the system. Absolutely no synchonisation is
required between the threads.
<P>
Another class of algorithm does require the previous result before the
current value can be computed. At first glance, this algorithm cannot
be threaded. However, if the algorithm is actually run many times with
each run being independent of the other runs, the algorithm can be
threaded. There is no global dependence on previous results, there is
only local dependence on previous results.  An example of this is
computing the Mandebrot set. While the inner loop is iterative and
cannot be threaded, computing the image values is a seperable
process. The Karma module <B>&lt;mandel&gt;</B> does this. Once again no
synchronisation between threads is required.
<P>
Yet another class of algorithm has both local and global dependence on
previous results. An example of this is computing the maximum value in
an array. It would appear this algorithm cannot be threaded. This is
not the case. The array can be divided into smaller chunks and the
maximum of each chunk can be computed independently from other
chunks. Once all chunks have been processed one simply has to
determine the maximum of all the chunk maxima. This too requires no
synchonisation between threads, but does require the result of each
thread to be collated (reaped). To support this requires each thread
to have a private working space which is initialised and then reaped
once all threads have finished. The
<A NAME="tex2html169" HREF="../lib/mt.html#mt_new_thread_info"><B>mt_new_thread_info</B></A> and
<A NAME="tex2html170" HREF="../lib/mt.html#mt_get_thread_info"><B>mt_get_thread_info</B></A> routines provide this support.
Alternatively, once the maximum is computed for a chunk (each job
works on one chunk), this value can be merged into the global
value. However this requires some synchronisation between
threads. When a thread wants to update the global value it needs to
aquire exclusive access to it, modify it and then release it. This is
termed ``locking'' a resource (the global maximum value). Provided the
period the global variable is locked is small, contention between
threads is kept to a minumum. The <A NAME="tex2html171" HREF="../lib/mt.html#mt_setlock"><B>mt_setlock</B></A> routine
provides locking functionality. In general it is better to use the
previous method of thread-private data and reaping the results.
<P>
A simple example of the first class is given below:
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001331000000000000000">Example 1</A></H2>
<P>
The following is a simple example program showing how an operation may
be easily parallelised. Note that while many modern parallelising
compiliers are able to parallelise simple nested loops, their
efficiency is usually far less than this simple &quot;hand tuned&quot; code.
The example creates a 2D ``Intelligent Array'' (1000x1000 floats) and
writes the value 3.0 in the entire array. Each line of the array is
filled in a separate job.
<P>
In real life one would actually use the <A NAME="tex2html172" HREF="../lib/iarray.html#iarray_fill"><B>iarray_fill</B></A>
routine instead, of course.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001332000000000000000">Example 2</A></H2>
<P>
This example is similar to the one above, except that instead of
dividing the array into lines and processing one line per job, the
work is divided by the number of concurrent threads available
(i.e. the number of CPUs). Hence each job processes a number of
lines. The reason behind this is to reduce the (already small)
overhead of launching jobs. Note that this assumes that each job takes
the same amount of time. If this is not the case, some threads will be
idle part of the time, and the work will take longer because of the
bad load balancing. This can be improved by increasing the number of
jobs (perhaps by a factor of 4), hence reducing the maximum time any
thread spends idle. If the number of jobs is increased too much the
overheads may become significant, so one needs to make a
compromise. Hence I suggest 4.
