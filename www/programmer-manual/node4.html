<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00410000000000000000">Purpose</A></H1>
<P>
The basic Input/Output class in Karma is the ``channel''. This is
provided by the <A NAME="tex2html16" HREF="../lib/ch.html"><B>ch</B></A> package. A channel is a (possibly) full
duplex buffered stream of data.
<P>
A channel may be associated with a file (disc file, named FIFO, tty,
etc.), a connection to another process, a memory object, and others.
A single interface for reading and writing is presented by the
<A NAME="tex2html17" HREF="../lib/ch.html"><B>ch</B></A> package.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00420000000000000000">Advantages over FILE * streams</A></H1>
<P>
Channels are similar to the standard C library FILE * streams, but fix
a number of serious deficiencies in FILE * streams, such as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> separate read and write buffers which give you proper
full-duplex operation. FILE * streams require painful rewind and flush
operations whenever you wish to change between reading and writing
over bi-directional connections. Excessive flushing reduces the
efficiency of FILE * streams to the point where you may as well not
use them at all
<LI> recovery from signals rather than failure. This means the
application does not have to clean up after a signal is delivered
which interrupted an I/O transfer. The library automatically restarts
the remaining transfer
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Besides these changes, a number of powerful enhancements are available
with Channels:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> query routines (methods) to determine what type of channel
subclass a particular channel object is
<LI> simple syntax for making a full-duplex connection to a Unix or
TCP/IP socket
<LI> support for automatic decompression of disc-based channels
<LI> the ability to push a stack of filter functions (termed
``converters'') onto a Channel. Examples of useful converters include
encryption and compression filters. These converters do not change the
interface to Channels, hence their effect is transparent to the
application
<LI> support for memory-mapping disc files. This means that the
entire file contents are mapped into the process virtual memory
space. This is especially useful if you wish to ``read'' a large data
file into memory: with a suitable file format like the Karma format
the data file can be mapped without any need to read the contents: the
array data is directly available in the mapped region. Not having to
read the file contents can save an enormous amount of time of you only
need to access a small part of the data. Conventional techniques for
accessing small parts of a file have the disadvantage of requiring the
application explicitely read in the part of the data it requires: this
makes the application more complex. Memory mapping places that burden
on the operating system
<LI> memory-based Channels which do not require any file
storage. This is useful when it is easier to write some data into a
``temporary file'' and read it back later, but you would rather avoid
the performance penalty of creating and manipulating a disc-based
channel. Memory channels consume virtual memory space and are far more
efficient than disc channels unless they take a significant proportion
of physical memory (RAM), in which case their benefit is marginal
<LI> various optimised convenience routines to drain, copy and pad
to/from channels and between channels, read and write with byte
swapping
<LI> virtual channels such as data sinks (similar to <TT>/dev/null</TT>
but more efficient)
<P>
</UL><H1><A NAME="SECTION00430000000000000000">Using Channels</A></H1>
<P>
The interface to channel objects is designed to be similar to the
standard C library FILE * streams interface, however there a few
subtle differences:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> the <A NAME="tex2html18" HREF="../lib/ch.html#ch_read"><B>ch_read</B></A> and <A NAME="tex2html19" HREF="../lib/ch.html#ch_write"><B>ch_write</B></A>
functions take a buffer of bytes rather than a buffer of elements and
similarly require only one size parameter rather than two. Some FILE *
stream implementations may get confused when partial elements are
written (due to interrupted system calls, EndOfFile or other failure),
with no way to report to the application how many bytes were actually
transferred. In addition, with Channel objects it makes no sense to
split a single concept into two parameters
<LI> there is no equivalent to the <TT>rewind</TT> function, as the
<A NAME="tex2html20" HREF="../lib/ch.html#ch_seek"><B>ch_seek</B></A> function provides the desired functionality
<P>
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00431000000000000000">Tutorials</A></H2>
<P>
Below are a few simple examples which show how to use Channels.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00431100000000000000">Simple ASCII File Reader</A></H3>
<P>
This example shows a simple ASCII file reader for a 2-dimensional data
format. The first line contains the horizontal and vertical
lengths. The remaining lines contain the array data.
<P>
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;karma.h&gt;
#include &lt;karma_ch.h&gt;
#include &lt;karma_m.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char **argv)
{
    Channel channel;
    int xlen, ylen, x, y;
    float *array;
    extern char *sys_errlist[];
    static char usage_string[] = &quot;readfile infile&quot;;

    if (argc != 2)
    {
        fprintf (stderr, &quot;Usage:\t%s\n&quot;, usage_string);
        exit (RV_BAD_PARAM);
    }
    /*  Open the input file (this is a simple 2D format)  */
    if ( ( channel = ch_open_file (argv[1], &quot;r&quot;) ) == NULL )
    {
        fprintf (stderr, &quot;Error opening file: \"%s\"\t%s\n&quot;,
                 argv[1], sys_errlist[errno]);
        exit (RV_CANNOT_OPEN);
    }
    /*  Read the array size  */
    ch_scanf (channel, &quot;%d %d&quot;, &amp;xlen, &amp;ylen);
    /*  Create 2D float array  */
    if ( ( array = (float *) m_alloc (sizeof *array * xlen * ylen) ) == NULL )
    {
        fprintf (stderr, &quot;Error allocating image\n&quot;);
        exit (RV_MEM_ERROR);
    }
    /*  Now read data values in from the input file and write to the array  */
    for (y = 0; y &lt; naxis2; ++y) for (x = 0; x &lt; naxis1; ++x)
    {
        ch_scanf (channel, &quot;%e&quot;, array + x + y * xlen);
    }
    ch_close (channel);
    /*  Now do something with the array. Since the point of this example is to
        show how to use channels, let's not bother with being really useful  */
    return (RV_OK);
}   /*  End Function main  */</PRE>
<P>
If you wanted to add support for automatic uncompression of the input
file you would only need to change the call to
<A NAME="tex2html21" HREF="../lib/ch.html#ch_open_file"><B>ch_open_file</B></A> to:
<P>
<PRE>channel = ch_open_file (argv[1], &quot;rz&quot;);</PRE>
<P>
If the file has the extension <TT>.gz</TT> then the input file is
automatically uncompressed. Note that you must have the
<B>&lt;gzip&gt;</B> (GNU zip) programme in your <TT>PATH</TT>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00431200000000000000">Loading a simple Memory-Mapped Binary File</A></H3>
<P>
This example shows how to ``load'' a simple 2-dimensional data file
which is stored in binary format. The first two words contain the size
of the array and the rest of the file contains the binary single
precision floating point data. The first and last values in the array
are multiplied by 2.0 and ``written'' back. Note that this file format
is machine-dependant: if you were to read the same file on a
big-endian and little-endian machines, the results would be quite
different. So one would not use such a file format in real life. The
point of this example is to show how to use memory-mapping to avoid
slow reading.
<P>
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;karma.h&gt;
#include &lt;karma_ch.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char **argv)
{
    Channel channel;
    char *ptr;
    int xlen, ylen;
    float *array;
    extern char *sys_errlist[];
    static char usage_string[] = &quot;modfile infile&quot;;

    if (argc != 2)
    {
        fprintf (stderr, &quot;Usage:\t%s\n&quot;, usage_string);
        exit (RV_BAD_PARAM);
    }
    /*  Map the input file (this is a simple 2D format)  */
    if ( ( channel = ch_map_disc (argv[1], K_CH_MAP_ALWAYS, TRUE, TRUE) )
         == NULL )
    {
        fprintf (stderr, &quot;Error opening file: \"%s\"\t%s\n&quot;,
                 argv[1], sys_errlist[errno]);
        exit (RV_CANNOT_OPEN);
    }
    /*  Get the mapped file  */
    ptr = ch_get_mmap_addr (channel);
    /*  Get the array size  */
    xlen = *(int *) ptr;
    ptr += sizeof xlen;
    ylen = *(int *) ptr;
    ptr += sizeof ylen;
    array = (float *) ptr;
    /*  Now multiply the first and last elements in the array by 2.0  */
    array[0] *= 2.0;
    array[xlen - 1 + (ylen - 1) * xlen] *= 2.0;
    /*  Close the channel: this also causes the modified data to be written  */
    ch_close (channel);
    return (RV_OK);
}   /*  End Function main  */</PRE>
<P>
Notice how the call to <A NAME="tex2html22" HREF="../lib/ch.html#ch_map_disc"><B>ch_map_disc</B></A> specifies that
the file should be mapped so the memory region is writable and changes
made to the region are written back to disc. An application that did
not want to modify the file would instead ask for a read-only mapping
(an example application would be one that displays the first and last
values in the array).
