<P>
Dynamic extensions are a mechanism whereby you can have your own code
automatically loaded and executed by parts of the Karma library. This
requires that your operating system supports building shared objects
(often called shared libraries) and that loading of shared objects is
supported by the <B>dlopen()</B> function.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001710000000000000000">Rationale</A></H1>
<P>
An alternative to dynamic extensions is to modify the source code for
a Karma module or some part of the library. Modifying the code is
appropriate for a generic change (if you submit the code I can include
it in the mainstream Karma release), but if it's something specific to
your own work environment it might not be appropriate to include it in
the mainstream Karma. Maintaining your own private versions of pieces
of Karma can quickly become a maintenance nightmare, since newer
versions of Karma will contain bugfixes and improvements but don't
include your private changes. Simply replacing the Karma version of
some module or part of the library with your own version may not work,
since other parts of Karma may depend on new features which your code
does not have. Merging in your changes with each new source release of
Karma involves work, and does not solve the problem if you want to
install a new beta (binary-only) release of Karma, since you won't
have access to the source code changes until the next source release.
<P>
Other changes you may wish to make to Karma may require linking with
extra libraries. This is something that is unlikely to be included in
the mainstream Karma release, since it introduces dependencies on
libraries not commonly available.
<P>
To solve these problems, dynamic extensions are supported. These
provide a way to have your own changes integrated into the library or
a module, maintaining binary compatibility between different releases
of Karma. The aim is to allow you to include your own code without
having to worry about maintenance when you install a newer version of
Karma.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001720000000000000000">Architecture</A></H1>
<P>
Karma defines many ``services'' which can be extended in defined
ways. A service may be a module (i.e. the entire application), a
widget or some other part of the library. Each service will call
certain known functions within the relevant extension at defined
points in the execution of the service. There are three main classes
of services:
<UL>
<LI> packages
<LI> widgets
<LI> modules
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION001721000000000000000">Package Services</A></H2>
<P>
The service name for a package is the name of the package itself. For
example, the <A NAME="tex2html285" HREF="../lib/foreign.html"><B>foreign</B></A> package defines the <TT>foreign</TT>
service. Each package will call known extension functions specific to
that package. You will need to read the package-specific documentation
to determine which extension functions are defined for that package.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001722000000000000000">Widget Services</A></H2>
<P>
The service name for a widget is the class name of the widget. For
example, the <A NAME="tex2html286" HREF="../lib/Filepopup.html"><B>Filepopup</B></A> widget (section <A HREF="node14.html#Filepopup">13.17.2</A>)
defines the service <TT>Filepopup</TT>. Widgets may call the following
known functions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>ClassInitialise</B> this is called only once when the widget
class is initialised
<LI> <B>WidgetInitialise</B> this is called as the last stage of
initialisation of a widget instance
<LI> <B>WidgetRealise</B> this is called as the last stage of
realisation of a widget instance
<LI> <B>WidgetDestroy</B> this is called as the last stage of
destruction of a widget instance
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Each of these functions has the same interface definition as the
generic Xt class member functions. Note that not all widgets currently
call these extension functions. The widgets will be changed as
required (most widgets will probably never have extensions written for
them by anybody). See the chapter on widgets (section <A HREF="node14.html#widgets">13</A>)
where each widget documents any extension functions it calls.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION001723000000000000000">Module Services</A></H2>
<P>
The service name for a module is the name of the module
itself. Modules may call the following known functions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Xt_AppInitialise</B> this is called only once when the Xt
application context is created (this only applies to Xt-based
programmes)
<LI> <B>Xt_InEventLoop</B> this is called only once when the Xt main
event loop starts (this only applies to Xt-based
programmes)
<P>
</UL><H1><A NAME="SECTION001730000000000000000">Creating an Extension</A></H1>
<P>
You will need to compile your C source code with whatever option your
compiler uses for generating position-independent code. You may wish
to include <TT>$KARMAINCLUDEPATH/gmakedefs/general.h1</TT> in your
GNUmakefile because it defines make variables with the correct
compiler flags that you require for your platform. Once you have
compiled your C code, you will need to use the linker to generate a
shared object with extension <TT>.so</TT> which may then be dynamically
loaded. An example <TT>GNUmakefile</TT> is shown below:
<P>
<PRE>include $(KARMAINCLUDEPATH)/gmakedefs/general.h1

myobject.so: mysource.o
        $(LDso) -o myobject.so mysource.o</PRE>
<P>
This uses the implicit rule in <B>&lt;gmake&gt;</B> to compile the source
file into an object. If necessary, you may define the <TT>CFLAGS</TT>
variable to provide extra compile flags (the implicit rule uses this
variable).
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001740000000000000000">Configuration</A></H1>
<P>
A single file is used to configure the extensions available. Your
personal configuration file is scanned first, and is called <TT>
<IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=5 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5797" SRC="img4.gif">/.karma/extensions</TT> which specifies which shared objects are
available for the various services. After that the <TT>
$KARMABASE/site/share/extensions</TT> file is scanned to load any extensions
provided by your local <B>Karma</B> installer. Finally the <TT>
$KARMABASE/share/extensions</TT> file is scanned to load any extensions
provided with the Karma distribution. The format of this file is as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>SO_DIRS  directories
SERVICE  servicename objects</PRE>
<P>
where:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>directories</TT> is a colon-separated list of
directories containing shared objects. Simple Bourne Shell-like
expansion of environment variables is supported (such as the
``<IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=5 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5797" SRC="img4.gif">'', <TT>$variable</TT>, <TT>${variable}</TT> and <TT>
${variable:-word}</TT> notations). This aids the
maintenance of extensions for different platforms
<LI> <TT>servicename</TT> is the name of a service
<LI> <TT>objects</TT> is the name of one or more objects (separated by
whitespace) without the trailing <TT>.so</TT> extension
</UL>
<P>
It is legal to list the same service multiple times: this simply
concatenates the list of objects for that service. Functions will be
called in the same order in which the configuration files were
scanned.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION001750000000000000000">Example</A></H1>
<P>
The following is an example of an extension for the
<A NAME="tex2html287" HREF="../lib/Filepopup.html"><B>Filepopup</B></A> widget (section <A HREF="node14.html#Filepopup">13.17.2</A>) which defines the
service <TT>Filepopup</TT>. It adds a few accelerator buttons to the file
browser. Note how there is no state defined in the extension: using
static variables must be done with caution, since the same <TT>
WidgetInitialise</TT> function is called several times, once for each
widget that is created.
<P>
To use this, my <TT><IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=5 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline5797" SRC="img4.gif">/.karma/extensions</TT> file contains the
following:
<P>
<PRE>SO_DIRS  ~/.karma/lib/$MACHINE_OS
SERVICE  Filepopup myobject</PRE>
<P>
And the code to implement this follows:

Note how the exported function <TT>WidgetInitialise</TT> returns a
boolean value. <B>All</B> extension functions must return either <TT>
