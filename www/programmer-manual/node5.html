<H1><A NAME="SECTION00510000000000000000">Purpose</A></H1>
<P>
Communications are useful when writing applications which are
comprised of many modules (processes). Using communications, one can
even write applications to perform parallel processing on a
heterogeneous network.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00520000000000000000">Architecture</A></H1>
<P>
The communications support in Karma is built on a layered approach. In
fact, one of the original motivations for the layered approach to the
Karma library was the need to provide communications at a high level
of abstraction for most needs, but not to preclude access to more
basic communications when required. Also, in order to leave the future
of the communications open-ended, a layered approach, with increasing
levels of abstraction, was also seen to be useful.  The various
packages in the Karma library which provide communications support are
listed below.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00521000000000000000">``r'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The lowest level (most primitive) communications routines are in the
<A NAME="tex2html23" HREF="../lib/r.html"><B>r</B></A> package in the Karma library. These routines provide a very low
level interface to Unix sockets (on Unix systems). Routines exist for
allocating ports and making connections to ports.  These routines are
<EM>not</EM> recommended for use, as they are inherently non-portable
(outside of Unix, say) in their interactions, and too primitive.
<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html24" HREF="../lib/r.html"><B>r</B></A> package also provides other miscellaneous functions to
manipulate the process environment, determining the hostname of a
machine, computing port numbers, etc. These routines provide some OS
independent functions, and hence are preferred over the vendor
supplied routines.  The <A NAME="tex2html25" HREF="../lib/r.html"><B>r</B></A> package is a key package in
providing OS abstraction.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00522000000000000000">``ch'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The basic Input/Output class in Karma is the ``channel''. This is
provided by the <A NAME="tex2html26" HREF="../lib/ch.html"><B>ch</B></A> package. A channel is a (possibly) full
duplex buffered stream of data. These are similar to the standard C
library FILE * streams, but fix a number of deficiencies in FILE
streams. See the chapter on <A HREF="node4.html#chapterchannels">f</A>or more details.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00523000000000000000">``dm'' package</A></H2>
<P>
When a process uses communication channels, it must have some way of
responding to incoming data and events. Because the underlying I/O
support is provided by ``file descriptors'' (in POSIX environments), a
mechanism is required to respond to events on file descriptors.  This
is called ``descriptor management''. In Unix, there are two ways of
doing this. One way is to install signal handlers. Unfortunately,
becauses most code is not re-entrant, there are inherent dangers in
using signals. The other alternative is to using a polling loop to
watch for communication events. The <A NAME="tex2html27" HREF="../lib/dm.html"><B>dm</B></A> package provides the
means (when running under a plain Unix environment) to register event
callback functions to process communications events. The <A NAME="tex2html28" HREF="../lib/dm.html"><B>dm</B></A>
package also provides the <A NAME="tex2html29" HREF="../lib/dm.html#dm_native_poll"><B>dm_native_poll</B></A> routine
which does the actual polling for events. On Unix systems, this can
effectively place a process in hibernation until an event occurs.
<P>
When running under a different environment, say using the Xt toolkit,
the <A NAME="tex2html30" HREF="../lib/dmx.html"><B>dmx</B></A> package provides the callback registration
functions. This package does not provide a polling routine, as the
toolkit choosen supplies this function.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00524000000000000000">``chm'' package</A></H2>
<P>
This is simply a layer built on top of the <A NAME="tex2html31" HREF="../lib/dm.html"><B>dm</B></A> package so
that channel objects may be managed. This is generally a more useful
interface than that provided by the <A NAME="tex2html32" HREF="../lib/dm.html"><B>dm</B></A> package.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00525000000000000000">``pio'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html33" HREF="../lib/pio.html"><B>pio</B></A> package provides a simple means to transfer binary
data between a unified ``network'' format and local (host)
format. These routines write to/ read from channels. These routines
are handy for simple communications.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00526000000000000000">``conn'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The real power in the communications support in Karma comes from the
<A NAME="tex2html34" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package. This provides sequenced, reliable full-duplex
data streams.
<P>
This is the recommended interface for all user-level communications
(and most library communications too). The <A NAME="tex2html35" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package is
initialised with the <A NAME="tex2html36" HREF="../lib/conn.html#conn_initialise"><B>conn_initialise</B></A> routine. This
initialises the package. Note that the <A NAME="tex2html37" HREF="../lib/dm.html"><B>dm</B></A> package should be
setup prior to this. The <A NAME="tex2html38" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package provides support for
modules (processes) to connect to each other, using agreed upon
&quot;protocols&quot;. The <A NAME="tex2html39" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package does not enforce the
definition of a &quot;protocol&quot;, it just provides a means for modules to
differentiate between the various connections they may have. It is the
responsibility of the code implementing the protocol to determine the
format of data which may pass down a connection of a particular
protocol.
<P>
Each client module client that wishes to make connections with a
particular protocol to another server module must register the
callback routines which will process events on connections of this
protocol. If the client does not register support for this protocol,
it cannot make connections with that protocol.
<P>
Each server module which wishes to receive connections of a particular
protocol from other client modules must register the callback routines
which will process events on connections of this protocol. If the
server does not register support for this protocol, it cannot accept
connections with that protocol.
<P>
Each module may have both client and server support for zero, one or
more protocols. Also, each module may be operating both as a client
and a server for different connections. The difference between a
client and server (as far as the <A NAME="tex2html40" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package is concerned)
is that a client initiates a connection while the server accepts (or
rejects) the connection. See the section on security below which
details how access may be restricted.
<P>
In order to transfer data over a Connection, one must call the
<A NAME="tex2html41" HREF="../lib/conn.html#conn_get_channel"><B>conn_get_channel</B></A> routine to obtain the underlying
Channel, since all I/O is based on the Channel.
<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html42" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package, in conjunction with the <A NAME="tex2html43" HREF="../lib/ch.html"><B>ch</B></A>
package provides complete abstraction of communications. Higher level
library code and user code has no knowledge of the underlying
transport mechanisms used. This allows the library to choose the most
efficient transport available.  It is worth pointing out that the
communications abstraction does not come at the cost of speed or
efficiency, both in terms of raw throughput and turnaround times.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00527000000000000000">``arln'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html44" HREF="../lib/arln.html"><B>arln</B></A> package allows the reading (with blocking: waiting
for input) from the standard input of lines, while still polling for
other events. This package uses the <A NAME="tex2html45" HREF="../lib/chm.html"><B>chm</B></A> package for channel
management, hence is not applicable to Xt or XView toolkit based
modules.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00528000000000000000">``dsxfr'' package</A></H2>
<P>
Another fundamental part of the Karma library is the Karma Data
Structure. This flexible, heirarchical data structure can be simply
transferred between modules by using the <A NAME="tex2html46" HREF="../lib/dsxfr.html"><B>dsxfr</B></A> package. This
package defines the ``multi_array'' protocol, and provides simple
routines to read or write an entire data structure from/ to another
modules (or disc file).  Part of the definition of the
``multi_array'' protocol is that data always flows from the client to
the server, never the other way around.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00529000000000000000">``kcmap'' package</A></H2>
<P>
Another package in the Karma library is the <A NAME="tex2html47" HREF="../lib/kcmap.html"><B>kcmap</B></A>
package. This package defines an opaque dynamic pseudocolourmap
class. This provides a graphics system independent means to modify
colourmaps. In addition, it provides for dynamic changes to colourmaps
to be shared between modules by using the <A NAME="tex2html48" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package to
define the ``colourmap_indices'' and ``full_colourmap''
protocols. This allows processes attached to the same graphics display
and separate graphics displays (i.e. separate X displays) to
dynamically share colourmaps.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION005210000000000000000">``iedit'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html49" HREF="../lib/iedit.html"><B>iedit</B></A> package defines an opaque image edit instruction
class.  This is designed for simple image painting operations. The
<A NAME="tex2html50" HREF="../lib/iedit.html"><B>iedit</B></A> package also uses the <A NAME="tex2html51" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package to define
the ``2D_edit'' protocol which allows changes to an edit list to be
propagated to co-operating modules. Using this package, it is trivial
to implement a &quot;shared paintboard&quot; application for several users,
where each user sees what every other user is painting, in real time.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION005211000000000000000">``iarray'' package</A></H2>
<P>
The Karma library provides a simplified interface to the general Karma
Data Structure in the <A NAME="tex2html52" HREF="../lib/iarray.html"><B>iarray</B></A> package. This package defines
the ``Intelligent Array'' class.  As with the <A NAME="tex2html53" HREF="../lib/dsxfr.html"><B>dsxfr</B></A> package,
the <A NAME="tex2html54" HREF="../lib/iarray.html"><B>iarray</B></A> package provides similar routines to transfer
data between modules and to/from disc files.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00530000000000000000">Addressing and Network Layers</A></H1>
<P>
To make a connection from a Karma client to a Karma server, the<BR> 
<A NAME="tex2html55" HREF="../lib/conn.html#conn_attempt_connection"><B>conn_attempt_connection</B></A> function is given a <EM>
hostname</EM> parameter which specifies which computer the Karma server is
running on. This may be a standard Internet address. The special names
<TT>unix</TT> and <TT>localhost</TT> refer to the same computer as where the
client is running. The special name <TT>local-slow</TT> is the same,
except that a slower transport mechanism is used instead.
<P>
By default the best reliable network protocol is used, which usually
means that TCP/IP or Unix domain sockets are used. You can specify
alternative network protocols by appending a protocol name after the
<EM>hostname</EM>, with a colon character in between. Currently supported
protocol names are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>stream</TT> use the best reliable protocol available (the
default)
<A NAME="244">&#160;</A><A NAME="245">&#160;</A>
<LI> <TT>udp</TT> use UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to send datagrams
<A NAME="247">&#160;</A><A NAME="248">&#160;</A>
<LI> <TT>atmsvc</TT> use a native ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mechanism)
SVC (Switched Virtual Circuit) connection, with AAL5, to send
datagrams.
</UL>
<P>
Note that when you ask for a datagram protocol, you may end up with an
unreliable connection. This means that datagrams (packets) may be
corrupted or lost, which means you may need to send them again. The
normal, reliable communication channel is still available as the
default channel, but you get an extra communication channel for the
datagram protocol. You can use the
<A NAME="tex2html56" HREF="../lib/conn.html#conn_get_datagram_channel"><B>conn_get_datagram_channel</B></A> function to yield the
datagram channel. The <A NAME="tex2html57" HREF="../lib/conn.html#conn_get_channel"><B>conn_get_channel</B></A> function
will return the normal, reliable channel. This channel allows you to
send data reliably, and use the datagram channel for less critical,
high-bandwidth data.
<P>
If you specify a <EM>hostname</EM> of <TT>my.host:stream</TT> this is the
same as <TT>my.host</TT> which will yield a reliable
connection. Specifying <TT>my.host:atmsvc</TT> will make a connection
with an ATM SVC AAL5 datagram channel.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00531000000000000000">Quality of Service Parameters</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="260">&#160;</A><A NAME="261">&#160;</A>
<P>
Some network protocols (such as ATM) allow you to specify quality of
service parameters. This means you can negotiate with the network the
sustained, minimum and maximum speed and other quality of service
parameters such as delay variation, and your connection will not
degrade in performance for its duration. Obviously, if the network
does not have sufficient resources to meet your demands, the
connection attempt will fail, in which case you may elect to try again
later or try for a connection with lesser quality. In the future,
networks will allow you to trade off service quality versus
cost. During peak usage periods, the cost of a connection of a
particular quality would be higher than during periods of low network
activity (such as late at night).
<P>
Karma provides the mechanism to specify desired quality of service
parameters. You specify these in the <EM>hostname</EM> string, by
including <TT>name=value</TT> pairs after the connection protocol, using
a comma character as a separator. The currently supported QOS
parameters are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>class</TT> the traffic class, either <TT>ubr</TT> (unassigned bit
rate: i.e. ``best-effort'', which is the default) or <TT>cbr</TT>
(constant bit rate)
<LI> <TT>txmin</TT> minimum peak transmit rate (bandwidth). This only
applies to <TT>class=cbr</TT>
<LI> <TT>txtyp</TT> the sustained peak transmit rate (bandwidth). This
only applies to <TT>class=cbr</TT>
<LI> <TT>txmax</TT> maximum peak transmit rate (bandwidth). This only
applies to <TT>class=cbr</TT>
<LI> <TT>txsdu</TT> the maximum transmit service data unit (packet size)
in bytes
<LI> <TT>txdvmax</TT> the maximum transmit per byte delay variation, in
nanoseconds. This only applies to <TT>class=cbr</TT>
<LI> <TT>rxmin</TT> minimum peak receive rate (bandwidth). This only
applies to <TT>class=cbr</TT>
<LI> <TT>rxtyp</TT> the sustained peak receive rate (bandwidth). This
only applies to <TT>class=cbr</TT>
<LI> <TT>rxmax</TT> maximum peak receive rate (bandwidth). This only
applies to <TT>class=cbr</TT>
<LI> <TT>rxsdu</TT> the maximum receive service data unit (packet size)
in bytes
<LI> <TT>rxdvmax</TT> the maximum receive per byte delay variation, in
nanoseconds. This only applies to <TT>class=cbr</TT>.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Note that bandwidth parameters are given in bytes per second. The
following units are recognised:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>b</TT> bits per second
<LI> <TT>B</TT> bytes per second
<LI> <TT>kb</TT> kilo (1000) bits per second
<LI> <TT>kB</TT> kilo (1000) bytes per second
<LI> <TT>Mb</TT> mega (1000000) bits per second
<LI> <TT>MB</TT> mega (1000000) bytes per second
</UL>
<P>
and may be used as a suffix for the numerical value.
<P>
Thus, if you wanted an ATM SVC AAL5 CBR connection with a sustained
transmit rate of 1000000 bits per second to host <TT>my.host</TT>, you
would specify<BR> <TT>my.host:atmsvc,class=cbr,txtyp=1Mb</TT> for the <EM>
hostname</EM>.
<P>
Note that the syntax for QOS parameters is experimental and may change
in future releases.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00540000000000000000">Tutorials</A></H1>
<P>
In a simple module, the following sequence should be followed if
communications are required:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Register the channel management package applicable
<LI> Register any client or server protocols
<LI> Optionally allocate a server port
<LI> Enter the polling loop
</UL>
<P>
In the case where a module only wishes to transmit data, and is not
interested in input (or closure) events on connections, it can omit
the stage where the polling loop is entered.
<P>
Some examples follow.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00541000000000000000">Example 1</A></H2>
<P>
This simple example is a module which generates some data (a 2
dimensional Intelligent Array) and then wishes to transmit this to a
module (name ``receiver'') on another machine (with name
``localhost'').

connection management
<P>
When developing a complex application comprised of many communicating
modules, the establishment of connections (and even the starting of
modules) can become rather difficult to manage, with connection
attempts (calls to <A NAME="tex2html58" HREF="../lib/conn.html#conn_attempt_connection"><B>conn_attempt_connection</B></A>) in many
different modules. To streamline this, there exists the Connection
Management shell, an interpreter which reads a script file. The script
file specifies which hosts modules will run on, which modules should
be run and the connections between all the modules.  This script
allows the application designer to centralise the startup of modules
and connections: making the application somewhat self-documenting.
<P>
Modules started locally have the same working directory as the script,
whereas modules started on other hosts have an undefined working
directory.
<P>
Modules started with the Connection Management Shell have their output
redirected to logfiles in /tmp
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00551000000000000000">Script Syntax</A></H2>
<A NAME="310">&#160;</A>
<P>
The syntax for Connection Management Shell scripts is processed in
order, and consists of 5 sections. Each section is prefixed with a
keyword and postfixed with ``<B>END</B>''. In between the prefix and
postfix is the body of the section, which contains zero or more
configuration line. The section keywords and their contents are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>HOSTLIST</B> each line contains a hostname where modules will
be run on, and zero or more optional arguments. The format is as
follows:<BR> 
<TT>hostname [KARMABASE] [-manual] [- args...]</TT><BR> 
where <TT>hostname</TT> is the remote host where you may want to run
modules. You can supply an optional <TT>KARMABASE</TT> which specifies
the value of the <TT>KARMABASE</TT> environment variable for modules run
on the remote host. The <TT>-manual</TT> switch is required if the host
where the script runs cannot execute remote shell commands on the
remote host. Any arguments following the <TT>-</TT> are passed to the
slave programme run on the remote host
<LI> <B>MODULES</B> each line contains a module to be run. The format
is as follows:<BR> 
<TT>hostname  module_name  [x y] [- args...]</TT><BR> 
where <TT>hostname</TT> is the host on which to run the module, <TT>
module_name</TT> is the name of the module to run. You can optionally
specify the position of the module icon in the Connection Management
Tool with <TT>x y</TT>. Further module-specific arguments may be
specified after the <TT>-</TT>. The first module started is given the
index number zero, each subsequent module is given an index number one
higher than the previous one
<LI> <B>CONNECTIONS</B> each line specifies a connection to make
between two modules. The format is:<BR> 
<TT>client_module_num  server_module_num  protocol_name
[transport]</TT><BR> 
where <TT>client_module</TT> is the index number of the module which is
making the connection (the client) and <TT>server_module_num</TT> is
the index number of the module to which the connection is made (the
server). You specify the protocol name for the connection with <TT>
protocol_name</TT> and an optional transport layer specification with
<TT>transport</TT> (this may be used to specify UDP or ATM SVC
connections)
<LI> <B>COMMANDS</B> this section is optional. Each line contains a
string command to send to the command line parser of a module. The
format is:<BR> 
<TT>module_num  delay  command</TT><BR> 
where <TT>module_num</TT> is the index number of the module to which to
send the command to, <TT>delay</TT> is the number of milliseconds to wait
after the command is sent and <TT>command</TT> is the command string to
send
<LI> <B>SHELL_CLEANUP</B> this section is optional. Each line
contains a Bourne Shell command to execute. This section requires no
``<B>END</B>'' postfix.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00552100000000000000">Authentication</A></H3>
<P>
In a networked environment, any client module is able to make a
connection to a server module. On the Internet, this means every
machine with Internet access can potentially connect to your server
module. In many (most) cases, this is not a concern since your server
module will only be running a short time. However, there may be
circumstances which require a more prudent approach. The Karma
communications infrastructure provides multiple levels of
authentication verification to support your needs.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00552200000000000000">Encryption</A></H3>
<P>
Distinct from authentication is the issue of privacy. Since the Karma
communications infrastructure utilises the network transport
facilities provided by the operating system, the level of privacy is
the same as that provided by the network layer. On a local area
network (LAN), you can expect that every machine on that network is
capable of spying on your data as it passes over the network. For most
people, this is probably not a serious concern since their data files
are also transferred over this network. Of greater concern is the
possibility of information to be captured as it passes between two
machines, each on a different LAN. If you are transferring data
between two machines across the Internet, you really have no idea of
who might be spying on your data. Karma provides strong encryption to
assure your privacy.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00552300000000000000">Purpose</A></H3>
<P>
The Karma communcations security support is aimed at:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Individual users who want to secure their communications
<LI> Application developers who want to write secure, network-aware
applications without worrying about the implemtation details
<LI> Commercial service providers on the Internet who wish to ensure
their own security and that of their customers.
<P>
</UL><H3><A NAME="SECTION00552400000000000000">Details</A></H3>
<P>
All connections maintained by the <A NAME="tex2html59" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package may be both
authenticated and encrypted. The configuration of this is centralised
in your &nbsp;/.KARMAauthority file (this file should bar all access except
for the owner). You may set a uniform authentication/encryption
requirement for all Karma protocols, or you may selectively protect
some protocols. If a protocol is not specified in your authority file,
the default authentication/encryption is used.  The format of this
file is a follows (one line per protocol):
<P>
<TT>protocol_name  security_type  [extra information]</TT>
<P>
The &lt;protocol_name&gt; may be any protocol name (a specific module
need not support a protocol). The name ``RAW_PROTOCOL'' designates
the raw Karma protocol used by the <A NAME="tex2html60" HREF="../lib/conn.html"><B>conn</B></A> package prior to
negotiating a specific application protocol.
<P>
&lt;security_type&gt; may be any of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>key-only</TT> IDEA used to verify authentication. Data unencrypted
<LI> <TT>IDEA</TT> IDEA used to verify authentication and data encrypted
<LI> <TT>PGPuserID-IDEA</TT> PGP used for session key transfer, then use
IDEA mode
<LI> <TT>drop-encryption</TT> drop data encryption for a specific
protocol
</UL>
<P>
For both the <TT>key-only</TT> and <TT>IDEA</TT> modes, the security type
field must be followed by a 24 byte IDEA session key and CFB
initialisation vector. This data must be in ASCII hexadecimal
format. Both these modes require the secure transfer of the authority
file.
<P>
The <TT>PGPuserID-IDEA</TT> mode is the most secure: the server module
uses PGP (Philip R. Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy) to encrypt a
random IDEA session key which is sent the the client module. The
client module uses PGPdaemon (part of the PGPsendmail/Unix Suite
available from:<BR> 
<A NAME="tex2html61" HREF="ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/">ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/</A>)
to decode this session key.  The security type field must be followed
by the authorised PGP userID.  You must have PGP and PGPsendmail/Unix
1.4.1 or later installed.
<P>
The <TT>drop-encryption</TT> mode allows you to drop encryption for a
specified protocol. This is useful when you have specified an
encryption mode for all protocols (using <TT>RAW_PROTOCOL</TT>) and you
are concerned about the performance degradation of encrypting data.
<P>
Note that in all cases, encryption is automatically dropped after
protocol authentication if the connection is local (i.e. a connection
to the same machine).
<P>
